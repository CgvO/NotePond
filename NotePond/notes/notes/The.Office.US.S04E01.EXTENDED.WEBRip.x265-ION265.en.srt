1
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,271
- Okay... Well,
I did not get the job

2
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,024
in New York, but I
got the real prize.

3
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,401
Domestic bliss.

4
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,611
Jan made me breakfast
this morning.

5
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,365
Well, she bought the milk.

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,451
It's soy.

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,537
Very healthy.

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,831
I'm trying new things.

9
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,792
New tastes and after tastes,

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,295
this is why I do it.

11
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,839
That's what I have
to come home to.

12
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,049
(Jan snoring)

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,216
(sigh)

14
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,305
She probably won't be
up for a few hours.

15
00:00:55,347 --> 00:00:57,432
This is going to be
a very good year.

16
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:58,725
Very good.

17
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,518
Jane is at home.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,020
Jim is back.

19
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,732
My protege, Ryan, is
at corporate. Good stuff.

20
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,070
Andy and Dwight are
rocking the sales team.

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,529
I feel very blessed.

22
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,240
(tires screech)
(loud thump)

23
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:22,415
(upbeat theme music)

24
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,523
**

25
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,157
{\an8}- Generally, it's not a good
idea to click on any Internet

26
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,118
{\an8}offers that you
haven't requested.

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,036
What was the exact offer?

28
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,914
{\an8}- It was for a video.
- Yeah.

29
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,666
{\an8}What kind of video?

30
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:07,127
{\an8}A celebrity sex tape.

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,838
Really?

32
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,631
- What kind of celebrity?
- It's not relevant.

33
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,383
- How much did you pay for it?
- Not relevant.

34
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,969
{\an8}- You paid for it?
- It all happened so fast.

35
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,595
{\an8}I broke up with Karen after

36
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:22,434
{\an8}the job interview,
and it was a little awkward.

37
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,269
{\an8}When she came back
from the city,

38
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,604
{\an8}she told me very clearly
that just because we were

39
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,565
{\an8}broken up didn't mean that she
was going anywhere,

40
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,359
{\an8}because she had worked
really hard for a career.

41
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,529
But the next day,
her desk was empty.

42
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,950
{\an8}And as for me and my
current romantic life,

43
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,161
{\an8}I uh, I'm single now.

44
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,579
{\an8}And looking.

45
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,373
{\an8}So, if you know anybody.

46
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,542
{\an8}- Jim and I went
to dinner a few times

47
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,336
{\an8}when he got back
from New York.

48
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,379
{\an8}I talked him through
his breakup.

49
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,674
{\an8}It's really nice to be
good friends again.

50
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,510
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

51
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,930
{\an8}Pam and Jim are
totally hooking up.

52
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,474
{\an8}All they do is smile.

53
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,602
{\an8}They're just keeping
it a secret, right?

54
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,603
I don't know.

55
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,980
{\an8}There is no evidence
of intimacy.

56
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,982
{\an8}They've been
in remarkably good moods.

57
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,108
{\an8}It could be other things.

58
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,569
Are you kidding me?

59
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,112
And Sunday,

60
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,239
I'm thinking of going to that
flea market at the drive in.

61
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,616
Oh, that sounds fun.

62
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,535
I'm mountain biking on Sunday
on Montage Mountain.

63
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,538
- Cool, well, have
fun with that.

64
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,214
Ladies and gentlemen,

65
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,384
I have some bad news.

66
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,969
Meredith was hit by a car.

67
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,471
(group chatter)

68
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,431
- It happened this morning
in the parking lot.

69
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,475
I took her to the hospital

70
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:48,478
and the doctors tried
to save her life.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,522
They did the best
that they could,

72
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,441
and she is going to be okay.

73
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,819
What is wrong with you?

74
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,696
Why did you have
to phrase it like that?

75
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,364
- So, she's really
going to be fine?

76
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,991
- Yes.
She has a slight

77
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,913
pelvical fracture, but people
have survived far worse.

78
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,832
Thank God you were there.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,042
Yeah.

80
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,129
- Did you see who did it?
- No need.

81
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,505
We can just check
the security tapes.

82
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:17,382
- Yeah, kind of good news,
bad news there.

83
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,300
I was able to be on the scene

84
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,012
so quickly because I was
in the car that hit her.

85
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:26,516
Who was driving?

86
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,272
Oh, Michael.

87
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,732
- One day,
Michael came in complaining

88
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,526
about a speed bump
on the highway.

89
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,030
I wonder who he ran over then.

90
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,408
You ran over Meredith this

91
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,286
- morning in the parking lot?
- And saved her life.

92
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,580
Yes, by taking her
to the hospital.

93
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,041
- They cut back the
Christmas gift, then,

94
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,751
no personal calls from work.

95
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,336
Now we get run over?

96
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,838
I did get 25 points, though,

97
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,550
for hitting Meredith, like in
that movie Death Race 2000.

98
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,847
(quietly) You get
points for hitting people.

99
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,937
We need to do any cleanup.

100
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,938
No.

101
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,318
- I've been playing this
game for a long time.

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,361
Let me tell you something,

103
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,780
Meredith ain't
worth no 25 points.

104
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,501
I am heartsick over it.

105
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,838
They look to me to lead them
toward a better future,

106
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,636
to fulfill and enrich
their lives.

107
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,973
And instead, I put one
of them in the hospital.

108
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,643
It's only Meredith.

109
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,353
Yeah, it's only Meredith.

110
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,771
Thank God.

111
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,439
But did you see the way they

112
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,734
looked at me? Like I was
a murderer or something.

113
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,860
Hey.

114
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,155
Why did you do it?

115
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,323
It was an accident.

116
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,700
Was she talking back?

117
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,035
- No.
- Did you get sick of that face?

118
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,496
Did she owe you money?
Uh-oh.

119
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,331
Is this downsizing?

120
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,542
Did she spurn your advances?

121
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,295
- What else?
- I don't know.

122
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,339
- You don't like redheads?
- What else?

123
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,340
She was late for work.

124
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,925
- How about I hit
her by accident?

125
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,677
Okay.

126
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,763
Well, if you ever hit me

127
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,975
with a car, you better kill me
because I will come after you.

128
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,146
- I bet that's what
they're thinking.

129
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,859
- And this year's,
Dundee for best vehicular

130
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,071
manslaughter goes to
Michael Scott.

131
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:50,410
- I have a little tribute
to today's events.

132
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,040
* Meredith got run
over by Michael's Seabring *

133
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,209
* walking through the
office parking lot *

134
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,046
* some might think the driver
was drunk and speeding, *

135
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,966
* but only if they don't
know Michael Scott *

136
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,511
* Meredith got run over
by Michael's Seabring *

137
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,513
Maybe she hit me.

138
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,766
You ever think of that?
She hit me?

139
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,268
I don't know
whose fault it was.

140
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,646
I wasn't exactly
looking at the road.

141
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,692
- * Meredith got run
over by a Michael *

142
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:24,861
*

143
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,448
Sorry.

144
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,618
We should all go visit.

145
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,247
- Yes, I guess we should.
- Why is that?

146
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,582
I barely know the woman.

147
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,795
She sits all the way over
there. I'd visit Phyllis.

148
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,923
- No, we should go visit
and get her a gift.

149
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,592
If everyone puts in $5,
we can get a nice bouquet.

150
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,761
- That's a good idea.
Good idea.

151
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,805
I will put in ten
because I make more.

152
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,181
- And you hit
her with your car.

153
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,433
Maybe you should put
in your whole damn salary.

154
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,102
- Michael only hit her
because she was late.

155
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,019
Show up on time.

156
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:58,937
And you've got
nothing to fear.

157
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,813
That is not true.

158
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,106
It was a horrible accident.

159
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,400
- She should sue you
for a million dollars.

160
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,110
- Okay.
A million dollars.

161
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,654
What was she going to do with
that pelvis? Cure cancer?

162
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,157
What is he doing here?

163
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,744
- The receptionist's porno
crashed some hard drives.

164
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,790
- It's okay, Pam,
we all do it.

165
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,462
- Hey, guys, we're all going
to visit Meredith at lunch

166
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
and we're kicking
in $5 for flowers.

167
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:27,632
Who's we?

168
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,342
- You and Jim?
- No.

169
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,261
Me and Stanley
and Phyllis so far,

170
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,139
Oh. I bet Jim goes too.

171
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,307
- Yeah, I haven't
asked him yet.

172
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,143
Oh, I bet you asked.

173
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,728
I was planning on it.

174
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,688
I bet you were.

175
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,192
- Are you coming?
- I can't.

176
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,610
Sprinkles is sick.

177
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,488
She's been sick for some time.
Thank you for asking.

178
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,241
No one asks about Sprinkles.

179
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,870
I have to give her her meds.
I have to pet her.

180
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,830
And who will she
eat lunch with?

181
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,832
- Can't your other cats
keep her company?

182
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,835
- There's bad blood,
jealousies, cliques.

183
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,545
Angela, you are the chairman

184
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,921
of the party
planning committee.

185
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,883
I shouldn't even be planning
this, It's your job.

186
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,677
All right.

187
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,598
Don't worry, Angela.

188
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,851
You can eat lunch alone
with Sprinkles tomorrow.

189
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,146
Sometimes I curse the fact

190
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,191
that I was gifted with the
ability to party plan.

191
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,693
I mean, why couldn't I be
a good for nothing fatso

192
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,570
like the rest
of this office?

193
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,990
Hello, Hunter, it's Michael.

194
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,494
Yes, Jan is fine. Awesome,
fantastic.

195
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,870
Thank you for asking.

196
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,915
Is the man in? So, Ryan got
promoted to corporate,

197
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,084
where he is a little
fish in a big pond.

198
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,961
Whereas back here in Scranton,

199
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:53,176
I am still top dog
in a fairly large pond.

200
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,930
So who is the real boss?

201
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,851
The dog or a fish?

202
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,728
My Lord, my Liege.

203
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,938
Yes, Michael.

204
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,399
- So. I need a little
treat for the gang.

205
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,401
Something to win their
affections back.

206
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,402
Back?

207
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,112
Why is that, Michael?

208
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,073
- Well, I ran down
Meredith in my car.

209
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:15,949
(Ryan groans)

210
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,409
Did you do this on purpose?

211
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,994
- No, I was being negligent,
but she's in the hospital.

212
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,330
She's fine, recovering nicely.

213
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,165
Tiny little crack
on her pelvis.

214
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,583
But she will be up and...

215
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,543
- Did this happened
on company property?

216
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,086
Yes, it was on company

217
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,422
property with company
property.

218
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,383
So double jeopardy.
We are fine.

219
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,970
- I don't think you understand
how jeopardy works.

220
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:40,223
- Oh, right. I'm sorry.
What is, we're fine?

221
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,686
- People keep calling
me a "wunderkind"?

222
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,354
I don't even know
what that means.

223
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,273
I know what it means.

224
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,817
It means very successful
for your age,

225
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:54,696
so, I guess it makes sense,
but it's a weird word.

226
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:55,864
Look, I'm not going to give

227
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,825
you a prize for running
over an employee.

228
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,952
- Well, how does it benefit me
for you to be in corporate

229
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,454
if you don't cut
me some slack?

230
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,622
- It's not going to benefit
you to have me in corporate.

231
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,915
- Well, then
cut me some slack.

232
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,002
I mean, come on, you rub
my back, I'll rub yours.

233
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,130
Goodbye, Michael.

234
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,715
See ya.

235
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,801
Made a sale.

236
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,888
I do not know what
they were thinking.

237
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,516
- Hey, D.
- Hey, monkey, what's up?

238
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,018
- Can you do
me a little favor?

239
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,103
Go to my place at lunch and
give Sprinkles her medicine?

240
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,773
- Sure.
- I have to visit the alky.

241
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,983
- Check to see
if she's faking.

242
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,569
If a car hit me,
it wouldn't crack my pelvis.

243
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,779
You know what?

244
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,238
I bet she cracked it at home.

245
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,783
Jumped in front of the car
to get some worker's comp.

246
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:42,035
I wouldn't put it past her.

247
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,164
- My girlfriend who you
have never met.

248
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:50,085
Your loss. Is the only person I
can ever imagine being with.

249
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,421
We go together like topsoil
and manure,

250
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:58,510
like a tractor and a dozer
blade, like mulch and manure.

251
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,220
So, what do you need me to do?

252
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,972
- I wrote it out.
There's a diabetes shot.

253
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:05,225
Roll the insulin in your hands.
Don't shake it.

254
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,268
She gets an ace
inhibitor with her meal.

255
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,020
If you have to put her right
in front of the dish or she

256
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,856
won't see it because
of the cataracts. Mix one

257
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:15,485
capsule of Omega fatty acid
in with her kidney medicine.

258
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:16,653
And you want to give

259
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,197
that to her 15 minutes
after she's eaten.

260
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,741
And, Oh, there's a
fungal cream because

261
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,201
she has this infection
under her tail.

262
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,078
So, you're going to have
to lift her tail and put

263
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,080
the cream right
at the base of her tail.

264
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,331
Hey, Toby.

265
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,127
Kelly, we're going to visit
Meredith at lunch.

266
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,714
Kelly?

267
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,298
Well, Kelly's been so upset

268
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,844
about Ryan dumping her that
she can't even talk.

269
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,812
- Okay, I have an announcement.
- You pushed Darryl out

270
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,105
- the window?
- No.

271
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,065
- You shot Dwight?
- No, no, that is not funny.

272
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:57,152
I love my employees,
even though I hit one of you

273
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,239
with my car, for which I
take full responsibility.

274
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,075
But did you ever
think of this?

275
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,413
Would a sober person
walk in front of a car?

276
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,748
- Hey, Oh.
- I'm sorry,

277
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,208
are you saying that Meredith
was drunk at 9 a.m.?

278
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,752
- Well...
- That's despicable Michael.

279
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,170
There's no proof of that.

280
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,796
- That seems early,
even for her.

281
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,090
- That's not what, no.
No, I'm not saying that.

282
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,301
- That's disgusting
- Drunk?

283
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:24,596
No, you can't get
drunk off Kahlua.

284
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,431
It's just a kind of coffee.

285
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:28,433
Then what are you saying?

286
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,060
I am saying

287
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,147
that maybe I was drunk.

288
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,067
Did you ever think of that?

289
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,109
No.

290
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,362
Okay, look, I'm just trying

291
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,281
to take everybody's mind off
of this unavoidable

292
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:47,077
tragedy and onto more
positive things.

293
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,830
So, I thought we
should plant a tree.

294
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,083
- Oh, good. Means
we don't have to work.

295
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,043
- Okay, we're leaving
for the hospital at one.

296
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,837
- So, like a freedom tree.
- I can take three people.

297
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,923
- I can also take three people.
- Separate cars.

298
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:01,257
- Pam.
- All right, we'll get a card

299
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,218
at the hospital and we'll
sign it outside her room.

300
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,969
- Pam.
- Sales people can go

301
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,888
later in the day. Hourly
workers can go at lunch.

302
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,223
Okay, good, good.

303
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,100
So, we'll just all go down
there together at lunch.

304
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,685
- Excellent.
- I was thinking that...

305
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,146
- Good work, Pam.
Yay, Pam.

306
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,817
All right, since I am the
boss, I will drive as well.

307
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,819
- Who wants shotgun?
- You can't be serious.

308
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,654
You ran a woman
over this morning.

309
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,031
- Everyone inside
the car was fine.

310
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:27,784
Stanley.
Guess what?

311
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,993
I have flaws.

312
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,037
What are they?
Oh, I don't know.

313
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,914
I sing in the shower.

314
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,709
Sometimes I spend too
much time volunteering.

315
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,586
Occasionally I'll hit
somebody with my car.

316
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,296
So sue me.

317
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:43,717
No, don't sue me.
That's the opposite

318
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,468
of the point that I
am trying to make.

319
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,183
Hey, Jim.

320
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,019
- Kev.
- Hey.

321
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,938
I've got a good friend.

322
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,858
Yeah, she's really cool.

323
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,818
- Mmmhmm.
- 26.

324
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,945
She has a great sense

325
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:09,951
of humor, loves mountain
biking and the theater.

326
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,911
- Great.
- Maybe you would like to date

327
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,956
her since you're
not seeing someone.

328
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,166
Sure.

329
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:20,128
- Well, then, how about
tomorrow night?

330
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,048
- Oh, I can't tomorrow night
because I have plans.

331
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,799
Why don't you just give me

332
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,259
a number and I'll
call her next week.

333
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,511
- What's her name?
- Yeah Kevin,

334
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:29,512
what's her name?

335
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,017
- Now I have to find a cool
girl who mountain bikes,

336
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:37,562
and she has to be 26
with a great sense of humor.

337
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,357
And she has to be my friend.

338
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,360
Shoot.

339
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,242
I hate hospitals.
In my mind

340
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,454
they are associated
with sickness

341
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,248
and dis-health.

342
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,170
She looks like an angel.

343
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,089
- She looks awful.
- No.

344
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,507
- Okay, she always
looks like that.

345
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:06,966
It was not my fault.

346
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,968
- They don't have this kind
of technology at the vets.

347
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,929
- It's not fair.
- It's fair.

348
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,472
- You know what?
Why don't we go around

349
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,309
the room and say one
memory of Meredith?

350
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,895
I'll start.
I liked her jumpers.

351
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,398
They reminded me
of kindergarten.

352
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,735
Jim.

353
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,196
- I'll always remember
Meredith's back.

354
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:30,657
That's all I can
see from my desk.

355
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:34,244
All that red hair over
a nice, strong back.

356
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,496
Sometimes I pretend it's

357
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,874
Carrot Top, and he's going to
turn around and tell a joke.

358
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:41,543
She was fun loving.

359
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,502
Okay, no.

360
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,587
I said, Jim.

361
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:46,589
I think she's awake.

362
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,675
No, she's in a coma.

363
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,095
No.

364
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,098
Okay.

365
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,392
Meredith.

366
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:59,728
Woo-oo-oo.

367
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:03,231
Brought all your
friends from the office, Dear.

368
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,400
- At the same time?
- Yeah.

369
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,736
- Hello, Meredith.
- This is weird.

370
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,404
Brought you some balloons.

371
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,781
Here you go.

372
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,119
Tie these up, cheer up your
tubes. Oh, shoot.

373
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,620
Oh, for god's sake.

374
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,081
- Nurse.
- No, don't bother

375
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,708
the nurse,
just put it back in.

376
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,753
I'm going to be sick.

377
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,087
I'm going to puke.

378
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,341
- (group chatter)
- What are you doing?

379
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,842
Just give me that.

380
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:35,597
Thanks.

381
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:36,723
(Kevin clapping)

382
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,059
Does it hurt terribly?

383
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,393
No, it's not too bad.

384
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,936
They have me on a lot
of painkillers.

385
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,438
- Oh, really?
What kind?

386
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,693
Codeine, Vicodin, Percocet
Fentanyl, OxyContin, Palidone?

387
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,320
I have no idea.

388
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,241
- So, how's the
view, old girl?

389
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,119
Oh, there's a cemetery.

390
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,954
You think that's affiliated
with the hospital?

391
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,289
Or is it like a separate...?

392
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,125
- Okay, okay, okay, you could
just close that.

393
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,086
It was really great of all

394
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:08,463
of you to come and visit
me at the same time.

395
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,590
I'll see you guys
at the office.

396
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:11,758
(group chatter)

397
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,051
- Okay. Wait up, wait up,
guys, guys, guys,

398
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,469
Hold on a second.

399
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,513
You know what I was thinking
might be sort of fun?

400
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,475
Is if you forgave me
in front of everybody.

401
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,143
- Michael, I'm not
going to do that.

402
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,980
- You know what they say in
the Bible about forgiveness?

403
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:30,276
Forgiveness
is next to Godliness.

404
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:32,987
- It's not, it's cleanliness.
- Just Shh.

405
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,447
You cracked my pelvis.

406
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,990
I didn't crack your pelvis.

407
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,492
My car cracked your pelvis.

408
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,452
- Okay, your car
cracked my pelvis.

409
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:41,705
- Look, I just...
- You're not forgiven.

410
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,373
Apart from hitting her

411
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:47,335
with my car, I have been
so kind to that woman.

412
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:51,381
I have treated her
like my grandmother.

413
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,967
Grancy, not Nana.

414
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:56,678
Meredith is no Nana.

415
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,555
Which one is Jim?

416
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,186
- Hi.
- Yeah, heartbreaker.

417
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:07,105
What are you in for?

418
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,690
Diabetes.

419
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,445
- So, have you read about
Iran and the newspaper?

420
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,197
No, please spoiler alerts.

421
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,699
I'm only up till last Monday,

422
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:21,411
so don't tell me anything
about Iran or Iraq.

423
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:23,455
I want to be surprised.

424
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,167
I don't understand what is
preventing you from laughing

425
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,877
this off and giving
me a big hug.

426
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,170
You are not forgiven.

427
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,048
- Come on.
- Michael.

428
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,383
[All] Michael!
Michael!

429
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,344
Meredith won't forgive me.

430
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,346
Who's being mean now?

431
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,389
I ran over her by accident,

432
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,059
and she is not forgiving
me on purpose.

433
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,603
Why can't you just forgive me?

434
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:49,314
Why are you having such a hard
time laughing this off?

435
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:50,565
How do you know that you

436
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,859
weren't born with some
sort of abnormal pelvis?

437
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:55,278
That it was just bound
to crack at some point.

438
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,571
Nurse!

439
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,449
- I'm going to go get
you a stuffed animal.

440
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:01,826
- Just need some
water, my pills.

441
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,291
There's nothing in here.

442
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,252
Do I need to be liked?

443
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,462
Absolutely not.

444
00:20:12,504 --> 00:20:14,255
I like to be liked.

445
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,174
I enjoy being liked.

446
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:18,093
I have to be liked.

447
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,095
But it's not like this

448
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:23,932
compulsive need to be liked.

449
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,851
Like my need to be praised.

450
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,482
- Hey.
- Hey, monkey.

451
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:34,192
Any problems?

452
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,696
- Well, you left the TV
on and your cat is dead.

453
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:38,988
What?

454
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,448
- Sparkles,
the white one is dead.

455
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,658
Sprinkles.

456
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,993
- That was the
sick one, right?

457
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,334
- I thought she had more time.
- No.

458
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,506
Did she, look,

459
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,384
when you saw her,
how was she looking?

460
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,552
Really dead.

461
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:03,304
Like, just a dead cat.

462
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,764
(sobbing)

463
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,058
So, hey, come on.

464
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,186
Don't be sad, okay?
Just...

465
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,189
- She's in a better place.
- All right.

466
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,482
(sobbing)

467
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,192
- Actually, the
place that she's

468
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,696
in is the freezer
because of the odor.

469
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,865
(sobbing)

470
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:27,829
Okay, you know what,

471
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:31,124
everybody, let's just get over
the whole Meredith thing.

472
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,834
She cracked her pelvis.

473
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:36,171
A tiny little crack,
and she's going to be fine.

474
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,465
Michael, Angela's cat died

475
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,884
Sprinkles?

476
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,603
Oh, shoot.

477
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,024
I'm sorry.
Angela, man, what a day, huh?

478
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,735
How could it get any worse?

479
00:21:58,777 --> 00:22:01,196
The computer crashes
with the porn and then

480
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:06,785
Meredith with the accident
and then Sprinkles, gosh.

481
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,578
That's three things.

482
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,954
These things happen in threes.

483
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,124
- Ryan dumped me.
- And Ryan dumped Kelly.

484
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:16,294
You know, that's four!
Damn it.

485
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,796
We're into a new cycle.

486
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,924
I'll tell you what's going on.

487
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,842
This office is cursed,

488
00:22:25,553 --> 00:22:27,722
and we need to do
something about it.

489
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,391
Conference room?

490
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:32,102
- Maybe the conference room,
maybe the annex.

491
00:22:32,811 --> 00:22:35,230
I'm saying at least
right here is cursed.

492
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,606
Conference room.
Ten minutes.

493
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,526
I am taking responsibility

494
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,986
and it is up to me to get rid

495
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:46,241
of the curse that hit
Meredith with my car.

496
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:51,663
I'm not superstitious,
but I am a little stitious.

497
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,377
it's relief to know
that it's not just me.

498
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,420
The whole office is cursed.

499
00:22:58,461 --> 00:22:59,963
On the other hand,

500
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:03,008
I may have to deal
with the dark unknown.

501
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,052
Okay, let's just start
with the obvious.

502
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,805
Did anyone do anything

503
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,349
involving an Indian
burial ground?

504
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,350
Like what?

505
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,729
- Like park on it
or dig up a body?

506
00:23:17,022 --> 00:23:20,025
Toby, do you have anything
you want to tell us?

507
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:24,571
- No, I did not violate
an Indian burial ground.

508
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,531
In fact, I had some
good luck recently.

509
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:28,742
Alfredo's Pizza picked
my business card out

510
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:31,661
of the basket, so I get
a week of free pies.

511
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,830
- That's cool.
- Yeah, perfect.

512
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,833
So, our tragedy is
your good luck.

513
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:39,419
Satan.

514
00:23:39,461 --> 00:23:43,048
- Question, has anyone
recently offended a Gypsy?

515
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,759
- We have to have done
something wrong.

516
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,427
You ran over an employee.

517
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,137
That was the curse, Stanley,

518
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:52,015
and we are trying to find
the cause of the curse.

519
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,726
The Indians have this,
sorry.

520
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:57,562
Native Americans have this
thing called Karma,

521
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,523
which is a very important
aspect of the

522
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:01,900
TV show, I Am Earl.

523
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:05,403
Now, Toby winning
pizza is bad Karma.

524
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:06,988
In fact, Toby is bad Karma.

525
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,074
He has done some
terrible things.

526
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,325
And because of that,

527
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:12,452
he is divorced and he
doesn't see his kids.

528
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,121
- There's your
curse right there.

529
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:16,790
Toby has kids?

530
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:21,670
- Sprinkles
never hurt a soul.

531
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:23,755
God, in your infinite wisdom.

532
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,507
How can you do this?

533
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:26,716
She wasn't ready.

534
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,593
She had so much
left to accomplish.

535
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,762
It's only a cat.

536
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:31,888
You never,

537
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,848
you don't like them.

538
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,811
- Cats do not provide
milk or wool or meat.

539
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:39,771
- Dwight, you haven't seen
Meredith yet, have you?

540
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,773
- No, I have not.
- Well, I think you should go

541
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,942
to the hospital and
pay your respects.

542
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,485
I do not respect her.

543
00:24:45,527 --> 00:24:47,153
But I will go.

544
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:49,364
All right.

545
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:51,866
I would now like to talk about

546
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:54,911
each of your individual
religious beliefs.

547
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:58,289
- Oh, Michael, you can't ask
about religious beliefs.

548
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,750
Satan is a master of lies.

549
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,294
Everything he says
is the opposite.

550
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:06,172
- All right, well, then you can
ask about religious beliefs.

551
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:08,216
- Thank you for the
permission, psych!

552
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:09,884
All right,
let's just go around the room

553
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,012
and tell me what
you believe in.

554
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,723
- Catholic.
- Okay.

555
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:15,849
Presbyterian.

556
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,309
- All right.
Me too, Same religion.

557
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:19,686
All right.

558
00:25:20,645 --> 00:25:22,814
- I'm a Lutheran and
Bob is a Unitarian.

559
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,482
It keeps things spicy.

560
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:26,443
That's why we're cursed.

561
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,652
- I've been involved
in a number

562
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:30,238
of cults, both as
a leader and a follower.

563
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,531
You have more fun as

564
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,325
a follower, but you make
more money as a leader.

565
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:38,163
- Michael, I believe when two
people are right for each

566
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,708
other, that they should start
a physical relationship.

567
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,793
Apropos what?

568
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,379
Kelly, you are Hindu.

569
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:49,215
- So, you believe in Buddha?
- That's Buddhist.

570
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,093
- Are you sure?
- No.

571
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,678
- I think I know what
I'm talking about.

572
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,181
Buddha is fat and cool.

573
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,976
He's like God's fat
buddy who drives a car.

574
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,355
He's like God's
Chris Farley or God's

575
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,065
Horatio Sands.

576
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:08,360
And God is like
Cuba Gooding Jr.

577
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:10,862
I'm not saying God is black.
God, I think,

578
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,823
is a mixture of all
the colors of the spectrum.

579
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:16,910
- What are you?
- Well, if you're going

580
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:20,705
to reduce my identity to my
religion, then I'm Sikh.

581
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:23,166
But I also like
hip hop and NPR.

582
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:27,045
And I'm restoring a 1967
Corvette in my spare time.

583
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:33,927
- Okay, so one Sikh
and Oscar, are you Santoria?

584
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,428
I was raised Catholic,

585
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,765
but I'm agnostic now, so I
guess I'm a secular humanist.

586
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,142
Oh, great.

587
00:26:41,184 --> 00:26:43,436
We have a secular
humanist here.

588
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,813
That is disgusting.

589
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:46,731
- Michael, do you know what
secular humanism is?

590
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,274
Yes, I do.

591
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,152
It is a philosophy that says
people can improve their lives

592
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:56,157
through reason as opposed
to religion or superstition.

593
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,325
Oh.

594
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,743
Stupid.

595
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:02,247
- As a farmer, I know that
when an animal is sick,

596
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,333
sometimes the right thing
to do is to put it out of its

597
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,253
misery. With the electricity
we're using to keep Meredith

598
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:11,881
alive, we could power
a small fan for two days.

599
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,425
You tell me what's
unethical.

600
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:17,429
Blink once, if you want me to
pull a plug.

601
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,598
- Don't pull any plugs.
- How are you doing, Ms. Palmer?

602
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,600
- Better.
- Excellent.

603
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,310
- Are you a doctor
or a male nurse?

604
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:26,563
- I'm an intern,
which makes me a doctor.

605
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,274
Her chart doesn't indicate

606
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,776
that she had a hysterectomy,
but she did.

607
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:34,112
Or at least she got
time off for one.

608
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,407
- Ah, so, that is where
her uterus went.

609
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,285
Miss Palmer, the last tetanus

610
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,245
shot was when you were bitten
by bat a few months ago?

611
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:46,875
- Yes, Dwight here trapped it
in a bag against my head.

612
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,209
Just doing my job.

613
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,295
- It also says you recently
bitten by a raccoon?

614
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:51,338
And a rat.

615
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:53,506
Separate occasions.

616
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:57,469
- You spend your whole life
trying to get people to like

617
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,514
you, and then you run over one
person with your car,

618
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,641
and it's not even one
of the popular ones

619
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,602
and everybody gets
on your case.

620
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,187
Doesn't make any sense.

621
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:09,397
God is dead.

622
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,442
- If there was a God in Ryan
and I would be married by now.

623
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:16,237
- Maybe believing
in God is a mistake.

624
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,865
What did people
believe in before?

625
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,493
The sun?

626
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,827
Maybe we should do that.

627
00:28:22,869 --> 00:28:24,704
- Is this what you
guys do all day?

628
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:25,997
Yeah.

629
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:27,832
Maybe there's some sort

630
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:32,462
of animal that we can make
a sacrifice to, like

631
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,551
a giant Buffalo or
some sort of monster,

632
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:42,222
like something with
the body of a walrus,

633
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:48,269
with the head of a sea lion or

634
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:51,439
something with a
body of an egret

635
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:58,613
with the head of a Meerkat
or just

636
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:05,453
the head of a monkey with
the antlers of a reindeer,

637
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,916
with a body of

638
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:16,589
a porcupine.

639
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:21,636
- I will do some research.
- Okay.

640
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,513
I can help you with that.

641
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:28,268
So just to be safe,

642
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,894
they are giving her
the rabies vaccine.

643
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:31,396
Oh, God.

644
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:32,731
Rabies?

645
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:35,150
I was in the hospital
room with her.

646
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:36,317
How contagious is that?

647
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,777
- Is that like an STD or?
- No, no.

648
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:38,903
You've got to be
bitten by something.

649
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,072
This place is so cursed.

650
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,657
- Actually, the doctor said it
was lucky she came

651
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:45,076
into the hospital because
the only way to beat rabies is

652
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:48,663
to start treatment before
the symptoms set in, Lockjaw.

653
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,590
- I know a lot of you are very
upset with me for endangering

654
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:02,010
Meredith's life by hitting
her with my car.

655
00:30:02,677 --> 00:30:04,596
But it may make you feel
a little bit better to know

656
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:08,808
that before that happened,
Dwight endangered her life

657
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,479
by putting a garbage bag over
her head that had a bat in it.

658
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:15,106
- Six of one.
Really.

659
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:20,111
- Turns out Meredith has been
exposed to rabies, which is,

660
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:24,449
like, ten times worse than a
little crack in your pelvis.

661
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,700
Thanks to me

662
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,660
she went to the hospital
and I saved her life.

663
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:29,829
Curse is broken.

664
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:32,207
Curse is broken, people.

665
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:36,670
Oh, there is a God, and he
has a plan for us after all.

666
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,797
So go home, get some rest.

667
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:41,508
Very, very good work today.

668
00:30:42,175 --> 00:30:44,094
Got a lot accomplished.

669
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:47,138
Is there a God?

670
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,517
If not, what are all
these churches for?

671
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,770
And who is Jesus' dad?

672
00:30:57,899 --> 00:30:59,025
(car alarm beeps)

673
00:31:03,363 --> 00:31:06,199
- Oh well,
if they aren't together now,

674
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:08,410
then they probably
never will be.

675
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,996
I thought they'd
be good together.

676
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,249
Like PB and J.

677
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:18,586
Pam Beasley and Jim.

678
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,549
What a waste.

679
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,135
What a waste.

680
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,929
- I told you I'm not
dating anyone.

681
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,933
And even if I was, I don't
think it's anyone's business.

682
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,353
I mean, when I do fall
in love,

683
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:38,189
like when it's for real,
the last person I'm going

684
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:42,569
to talk about it to is a
camera crew or my coworkers.

685
00:31:46,656 --> 00:31:49,159
Almost marrying Roy Anderson
was as close

686
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,578
to Pamela Anderson as
I ever want to be.

687
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:54,748
Trust me when I fall
in love, you'll know.

688
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,926
Man, I'd really like to hit
that.

689
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,721
I hope this isn't
what he meant.

690
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:13,725
- I run over Michael every day
in my mind.

691
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,478
Is Ryan my boss?

692
00:32:17,645 --> 00:32:21,149
I don't know.
He is called the boss.

693
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:25,278
He has the power over
me that a boss has.

694
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:28,823
So no, we are equals.

695
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,867
Yes, Michael Scott.

696
00:32:31,326 --> 00:32:33,244
Things might be different
for him this year.

697
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:34,746
He can no longer protect

698
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:38,291
himself by starting a sexual
relationship with his boss.

699
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:45,799
- I've had Sprinkles
for 16 years.

700
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,219
I adopted her when I graduated
from accounting school.

701
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:51,888
I knew the kind of life I
wanted.

702
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:56,309
One with a companionship
and unpredictable good times

703
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:57,894
only a cat offers.

704
00:32:57,936 --> 00:33:00,855
- My cousin
Moses' best friend was a dog.

705
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:02,607
One day he was foaming

706
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:05,652
at the mouth, so I had
to shoot him dead.

707
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:09,572
Turns out he had only eaten
one of Moses cream pies.

708
00:33:09,614 --> 00:33:11,533
Did I feel bad
for killing him?

709
00:33:11,574 --> 00:33:12,575
No.

710
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,369
That's how you deal
with a thief.

711
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,204
Sprinkles lives with me.

712
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,081
Cares for me.
Listens to me.

713
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,334
Cheers me up, dries my tears.

714
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,587
Meredith steals my tape.

715
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,341
- Things we don't want
on Schrute farms?

716
00:33:28,383 --> 00:33:31,761
Beet weasels, teenagers.

717
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:36,057
Regular weasels,
teenagers with rabies,

718
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:40,895
unprotected sex. Things we
do want on Schrute farms?

719
00:33:40,937 --> 00:33:41,938
A new plow.

720
00:33:43,356 --> 00:33:45,984
(upbeat music)
