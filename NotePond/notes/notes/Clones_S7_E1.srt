1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,892
<i>The battle for Anaxes!</i>

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,729
<i>One of the Republic's largest shipyards
is under attack</i>

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,231
<i>from Admiral Trench's Separatist Forces.</i>

4
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:26,234
<i>Jedi Generals Mace Windu
and Anakin Skywalker</i>

5
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,612
<i>lead a two-pronged assault
on the ground and in the air.</i>

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>But after weeks of heated battle
and mounting losses,</i>

7
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:36,494
<i>the Republic's grip on Anaxes
begins to slip away.</i>

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:49,341
The droids have overrun
our main production facility.

9
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,760
It won't be long before
the Separatists take Anaxes,

10
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,137
compromising our entire reserve fleet.

11
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,931
Pardon the interruption, General,

12
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:01,061
but Rex here has a good theory
on why we keep, uh... losing.

13
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,146
Please, Captain.

14
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,608
The droid army uses analytics
to predict our strategy.

15
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,402
The first time we use a tactic,
it's very effective.

16
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,321
The next, less so.

17
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,448
In fact, the more we use a certain tactic,

18
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,825
the less effective it becomes.

19
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:19,496
They learn our tendencies
and use that data against us.

20
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,955
To counter them,

21
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,542
we're constantly working out ways
to vary our attack.

22
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,255
But the losses we are experiencing
on Anaxes are not commonplace.

23
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,465
Exactly.

24
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,926
The counterattacks are so specific,

25
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,513
it's my strategy the droids know,
my playbook.

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,724
My concern is that Rex is one of our best.

27
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,937
If the droids can learn to defeat him,
we may all be vulnerable.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,480
What do you propose?

29
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,401
Let Rex and me take a small squad
behind enemy lines.

30
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,361
There's a Separatist Cyber Center

31
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,948
which relays all battlefield intel
to their command ship.

32
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:57,867
If we're going to find anything,
it will be there.

33
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,955
If you think it will help
turn this fight around, get going.

34
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,623
Thank you, General.

35
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:07,627
Rex, is there anything else?

36
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,672
No, General.

37
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,287
Come on, Rex. Time to move out.

38
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,291
Fives, Echo,

39
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,792
and before that, Hevy.

40
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,587
There's so many troopers gone.

41
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,591
Yeah, regular folk don't understand.

42
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,053
Sometimes in war,
it's hard to be the one that survives.

43
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,638
That's what I'm worried about.

44
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,182
Well, what do you mean?

45
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,934
I didn't tell the Generals.

46
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,437
They might think I'm crazy.

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,065
In fact, you might think I'm crazy.

48
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,816
What is it?

49
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,027
I think Echo's alive.

50
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,989
That's not possible.
He died at the Citadel.

51
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,450
The way the droids are countering us here,

52
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,910
the strategies I'm using,

53
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,580
they're all old battle plans
Echo and I drew up together.

54
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:30,001
Look, Rex, I hear what you're saying.
But it's just not possible.

55
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,128
I hope you're right.

56
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,925
But the fact is, Echo's fingerprints
are all over these Separatist strategies.

57
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,093
Rex.

58
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,721
You have to admit what you're saying
is a long shot at best,

59
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,391
and most likely, misplaced hope.

60
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,601
I need you to be focused on this.

61
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,478
I-I know, I know.

62
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,562
Don't worry.

63
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,610
So, what squad are we taking in?

64
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,406
Clone Force 99.

65
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,831
I've heard mixed things about these guys.

66
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,833
They have a 100% success rate.

67
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,380
It's not that they win,
it's how they win that worries me.

68
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,676
<i>Repeat, coming in hot
on platform TT-3-9-7.</i>

69
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:24,305
Clear the airfield!

70
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,016
Clear the airfield!

71
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,192
So why haven't I heard of this squad?

72
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,654
Experimental unit Clone Force 99,

73
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,616
they're defective clones with,
uh... desirable mutations.

74
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,911
99, hey? Nice touch.

75
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,123
They call themselves "The Bad Batch."

76
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,311
The cavalry has arrived!

77
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,158
These guys are clones?
They don't look like clones to me.

78
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,954
Sergeant, good to see you again.

79
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,165
You too, sir.
This is Hunter.

80
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,709
Sorry we're late, Commander.

81
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:37,003
We were putting down an insurrection
on Yalbec Prime

82
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,421
when your comm came in.

83
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,050
Had a few unforeseen... complications.

84
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:45,136
Ever fought a male Yalbec?

85
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,723
Um, no. Can't say I have.

86
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,225
You're lucky.

87
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,143
Only way to kill 'em is with one of these.

88
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,271
That's right.

89
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,942
Wrecker here cut off the Queen's stinger
while she was still alive.

90
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,529
That's why all those Yalbec males
tried to eat us.

91
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,948
Uh, technically,
they were trying to mate with us.

92
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,866
And, for your information,

93
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,787
the stinger of a Yalbec Queen
is a delicacy on some planets.

94
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,664
They call him Tech.

95
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,876
Yeah, he can fill your head
with useless info for hours.

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,839
Crosshair, on the other hand,
he's not much of a conversationalist,

97
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,092
but when you have to hit
a precise target from ten klicks,

98
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,719
Crosshair's your man.

99
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,387
So, Commander,

100
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,849
what kind of "suicide mission"
do you have for us this time?

101
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:33,226
Let's get going.
We'll brief you on the way.

102
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,539
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,209
We don't usually work with "regs."

104
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,836
"Regs?"

105
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,214
He's talking about regular clones.

106
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,050
But don't take it personal.

107
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:08,178
We're all on the same team,
so cut the attitude and listen up.

108
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,765
Here's the mission.
Our target is this Cyber Center.

109
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,018
It's the "brains" of the entire
Separatist campaign here on Anaxes.

110
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,813
I could demolish that with one hand! Yeah!

111
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,774
This isn't a demo job, Wrecker.

112
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,234
It's strictly a retrieval operation.

113
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,660
Sector One, alert.
Enemy gunship approaching your location.

114
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,245
Come in, <i>Sector One.</i>

115
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:35,955
Roger, roger.

116
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,585
Fire!

117
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,674
Incoming fire!

118
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:01,815
We're going down!

119
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,505
We always get shot down
when we travel with regs.

120
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,048
Cody! Help!

121
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:31,302
He's trapped! We have to do something.

122
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,804
I'll get him.

123
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, Captain. Wrecker, get him out.

124
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,269
Get back!

125
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,064
This is ridiculous!

126
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,066
He's gonna need help
to get Cody out of there.

127
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,904
He's gonna get the gunship out of there.
Not Cody.

128
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,005
Boom.

129
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,893
He has internal damage.

130
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,520
I can cut the pain.
But he needs help fast.

131
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,981
We all need help.

132
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,654
That blast gave away our position.

133
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,450
I thought getting shot down
gave away our position.

134
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,910
Everyone, find cover.

135
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,454
We'll hold this position
and let them come to us.

136
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,832
I don't think so, Captain.
That's not our style.

137
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,459
We prefer going to them.

138
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,545
Bad Batch! Plan 82, "Shockwave!"

139
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,722
Let's get to work.

140
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,435
Blast them!

141
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,246
45. Mark 151.

142
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,164
45. Mark 151.

143
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,426
75. Mark 357.

144
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,011
75. Mark 357.

145
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,763
What the...

146
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,562
Spider droids. Fan out!

147
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,668
Any more? Come on!

148
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,640
That was some show you put on just now.

149
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,727
Just doing our job, Captain.

150
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,980
Hey, look, Crosshair,
this little clanker likes you.

151
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,108
Grow up, Wrecker.

152
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,903
We should move out
before reinforcements arrive.

153
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,780
Our position has been compromised.

154
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,470
We wanted to speak to you directly, sir.

155
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,723
This infiltration is irregular.

156
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,853
<i>Were there Jedi with this squad?</i>

157
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:10,814
Just clones.

158
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,275
But using tactics
like we have never seen before.

159
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:17,904
<i>Interesting.</i>

160
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,866
<i>They're on foot now,
in the middle of nowhere.</i>

161
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:25,495
<i>Sweep the area, locate these clones,</i>

162
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,749
<i>and notify me if the incursion escalates.</i>

163
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,943
So, I get what makes
the other Batchers unique,

164
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,945
but what's so special about Hunter?

165
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,448
He can put up with the other three.

166
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,867
He was engineered with heightened senses.

167
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,618
A place like the Cyber Center,

168
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,329
Hunter can feel
the electromagnetic frequencies

169
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:09,956
from anywhere on the planet.

170
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:13,668
And here I thought we were smart
just using a holomap.

171
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,422
Well, maps can be wrong. Hunter never is.

172
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,934
Hang in there, Cody.

173
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,272
Listen up. We have to move out.

174
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,068
Commander Cody's in no position to move.

175
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,694
Already called in Evac.

176
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,821
Kix will stay with Cody until it arrives.

177
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,198
I'm in charge now.

178
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:46,242
And I've got a plan
to get into that Cyber Center.

179
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,662
If your plans are so good,

180
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,749
why did Commander Cody have to call us in?

181
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,793
You can't talk to Captain Rex like that!

182
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:56,002
Says who?

183
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,587
Whoa!

184
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,673
Put him down!

185
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,592
Stay out of it.
Hey! Watch it!

186
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,761
Uh, guys, come on.

187
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:08,098
Wrecker, drop him. Now.

188
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,016
Aw.

189
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,727
Fellas, come on!

190
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,730
We're all fighting
for the same thing, right?

191
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,777
All right then.

192
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,155
Let's cut the chatter
and finish what we started.

193
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,909
We'll do it your way, Captain.
For Commander Cody.

194
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,246
Okay. Let's gear up and move out.

195
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,929
Not our primary target.

196
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:51,057
It's an outpost. Should we take it?

197
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,144
Probably easier than going around.

198
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,854
All right, what are your orders?

199
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,481
We pick them off from the tree line
one-by-one?

200
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:02,652
Actually, I was thinking
we'd take a page from your book.

201
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,237
Rush them head-on.

202
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,782
I like your style.

203
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,870
Clones! Get them!

204
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,351
Hey! You're not authorized...

205
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,992
Is it over already?

206
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,911
Aw, man!

207
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,914
Not bad. For a reg.

208
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,462
All right, there it is. The Cyber Center.

209
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:07,300
It looks like the Cyber Center itself
has minimal guards, about 30 droids.

210
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:09,427
Wait. Wait!

211
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,638
I got a massive signal coming in.

212
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,683
A whole platoon of droids
is headed this way.

213
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,602
Someone's noticed our handiwork
back at the crash site.

214
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,145
Yeah.

215
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:22,023
Make sure you keep an eye
on those incoming Separatist forces.

216
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,359
I want to know
when they reach this outpost.

217
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,736
You got it, Cap.
We've gotta move swiftly.

218
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,614
We'll grab some speeder bikes
and flank them from the back.

219
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,885
Do you know what's going on?

220
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,221
Maybe it's another drill.

221
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:58,685
Is everyone in position?

222
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,230
Affirmative.

223
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,691
Affirmative.

224
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:10,196
Cap, you wanted to know when those
Separatist forces breached the outpost.

225
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:13,116
Well, they're getting there
just about now.

226
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,296
Sir, we tracked
the Clone Strike team here,

227
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,466
they seem to have captured
this location and deserted it.

228
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:32,469
I cannot calculate the logic
of this assault.

229
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,974
<i>There is no tactical advantage
to taking the outpost.</i>

230
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,603
<i>Their target will be
the nearby Cyber Center.</i>

231
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,689
<i>They must know about the algorithm.</i>

232
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:49,194
<i>Get me in contact
with the Cyber Center at once!</i>

233
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,531
<i>Put all droids on alert.</i>

234
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,408
<i>An attack is coming.</i>

235
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:57,744
An attack is coming? When...

236
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,929
All units to the front door!

237
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,605
Hmm. This is a delicate operation.

238
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,608
Boom!

239
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:29,734
You take too long.

240
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,129
We're in.

241
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,978
Tech, get to work on these computers.

242
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,271
We'll go get the regs.

243
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,071
What the...

244
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,245
Hey, where did you come from...

245
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,919
What took you so long, Wrecker?

246
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,798
Hey, this is a "delicate operation."

247
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,220
Better get in there, Cap.

248
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,155
Okay, I'm in.

249
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,449
What am I looking for?
Here's the algorithm.

250
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,285
You're looking for a program
using this sequence.

251
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,123
Found it.

252
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,461
This is strange. It's not a program.

253
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,881
It's a live signal from another planet...

254
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,424
Skako Minor.

255
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,052
A live signal?

256
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:27,727
Crosshair, we're gonna need a lift.

257
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:33,817
Not gonna be a problem.

258
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,195
Here it is. This is audible.

259
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,114
Patch me in. I want to hear it.

260
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,703
What is that?

261
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:50,291
That sounds almost... almost human.

262
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,254
It can't be.

263
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,723
Uh-oh.

264
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,607
We gotta go! Now!

265
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,331
Tech, find out who's sending that signal.

266
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:31,791
Ask who that is.

267
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,838
<i>CT-1409.</i>

268
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:41,509
<i>CT-1409.</i>
I... I don't believe it.

269
00:21:41,593 --> 00:21:43,386
<i>CT-1409.</i>

270
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,806
We're gone. Rex, let's go.

271
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,476
<i>CT-1409.</i>
Rex, now!

272
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,188
<i>CT-1409.</i>

273
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,677
We have chased the clones
out of the center, sir.

274
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,180
They are retreating back
toward Republic lines.

275
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,726
<i>Did they download anything
from the central computer?</i>

276
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:34,479
There seems to be no intel missing.

277
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:38,024
But there appears to have been
a connection made with Skako Minor.

278
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,526
<i>What?!</i>

279
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:52,580
That number, Cap, what did it mean?

280
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,542
CT-1409...

281
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,669
that was Echo's number.

282
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,505
He's alive.
