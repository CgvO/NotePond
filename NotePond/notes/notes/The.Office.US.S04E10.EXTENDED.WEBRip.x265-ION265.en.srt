1
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,682
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Rolando.

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,517
Oh, yes.
She's been expecting your call.

3
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:21,896
(knocks)

4
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,356
[Karen] Yeah.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,942
- Karen?
He's on line one.

6
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,444
Thanks, Ro.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,781
Hey. We finally connected.
How's Scranton?

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:35,243
I am the regional manager
of Dunder Mifflin Utica branch.

9
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:38,163
Turns out it's a pretty easy gig
when your boss isn't an idiot

10
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,831
and your boyfriend's not
in love with somebody else.

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,292
Look, all I'm saying is it would

12
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,670
be a great opportunity and we'd
love to have you come aboard.

13
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,505
So think about it. Okay?

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,675
Okay, bye.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,552
Look, for the record,

16
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,430
a certain Scranton
salesman approached me. Okay?

17
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,516
- This is perfect!
- He looks like your twin.

18
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,018
This is a dummy.

19
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,770
Ala, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

20
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,439
We've tied a string to the
wrist, which goes to the door.

21
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,982
When somebody opens the door,

22
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,068
the hand goes down,
hits the remote,

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,363
turns on the tape recorder,
which is me snoring.

24
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,408
Now nobody knows whether I am
here or whether I am gone.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,326
I'll know.

26
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,536
But you will not tell anyone.

27
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:21,664
- I won't need to because we'll
be together, playing hooky.

28
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,876
- Sometimes, most of the time I
will be with Ryan or Darryl.

29
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,128
(knock on door)
Yes. Oh good, good.

30
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,338
Stanley first victim.

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,548
This is what I want you to do.
Go out.

32
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,258
Come back in.
We're going to hide.

33
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,177
I want you to tell me
if this looks like me. Okay?

34
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,428
- I don't understand
why sleeping

35
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,138
at your desk is better
than you not being here.

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,056
Just go out and come back in.

37
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,307
(snoring sound)

38
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,768
- I got an offer from Utica
for more money.

39
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,395
And I'm going to take it.

40
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,772
- What?
(door shuts)

41
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:52,195
(upbeat theme music)

42
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,559
- Hey, everyone. Can I have your
attention, please?

43
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:26,271
I just thought you all should
know that Stanley Hudson is

44
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,691
{\an8}planning on leaving us
because our old friend Karen

45
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,319
{\an8}from Utica is going to give
him more money to work there.

46
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,113
{\an8}- Okay!
(clapping)

47
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,698
{\an8}[Michael] No, no, no no!

48
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,701
{\an8}No, you completely
misinterpreted my tone.

49
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,244
{\an8}This is a horrible thing.

50
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,580
{\an8}Clearly, Karen is trying to get

51
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:46,291
back at us because
Jim dumped her.

52
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,417
- Oh, I don't think
that's what's happening.

53
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,377
{\an8}Okay, well, smarty pants.

54
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,798
{\an8}Then why is she trying
to take Stanley from us?

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,967
- I think it's because
of my sales record.

56
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,927
That could not possibly be it.

57
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,557
{\an8}You cannot take the hilarious
black guy from the office.

58
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,144
{\an8}Stanley is part of what makes
this branch so extraordinary.

59
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:07,479
{\an8}The bluesy wisdom,

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,316
{\an8}the sassy remarks,
the crossword puzzles,

61
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,778
{\an8}the smile, those big,
watery red eyes.

62
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,447
{\an8}I don't know how George Bush
did it when Colin Powell left.

63
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,783
{\an8}And if Utica thinks that they

64
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,952
{\an8}are going to poach Stanley,
they have another thing coming.

65
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:26,039
Are you gleeful over this?
Is working out for you, Jim?

66
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,667
{\an8}- It's completely
unrelated, so...

67
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,876
Was it worth it?

68
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,588
Was she worth it?

69
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,299
Yep, she was.

70
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,220
{\an8}- Look at Pam, everybody.
She likes this.

71
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,015
Oh. No, you missed it.

72
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,767
{\an8}Now she's ordinary again.

73
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,236
- How can I get you to stay?
- Money.

74
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,571
{\an8}Yeah. We all want money.

75
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,241
{\an8}But there is none in the budget.

76
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,785
{\an8}So tell me why you're
really leaving.

77
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,911
Money.

78
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,372
- More money, more problems,
Stanley.

79
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,124
You of all people
should know that.

80
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,917
{\an8}Let me ask you this.

81
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,794
- If I were...
- Money.

82
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,632
Oscar, did you bring it?

83
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,761
To be Edwardian.

84
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,846
His best work.

85
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,305
- Okay, well, I have
the tablecloth.

86
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,724
- Don't forget the flatware.
- Sure thing, Pam.

87
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,226
- Can't wait.
- [Angela] Sure thing, Pam.

88
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,062
- Fru fru club.
- [Kevin] Must be nice.

89
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,940
Look at me.
I wear underwear.

90
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,485
Oscar, Toby and I are founding

91
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,988
members of the
Finer Things Club.

92
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,698
We meet once a month to discuss

93
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,244
books and art, celebrate culture
in a very civilized way.

94
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,204
Sometimes the debate can get

95
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:51,583
heated, but we're
always respectful.

96
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,795
There is no paper, no plastic
and no work talk allowed.

97
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,215
It's very exclusive.

98
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,426
- Besides having sex with men,
I would say

99
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:04,471
The Finer Things Club is
the gayest thing about me.

100
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,556
I love the Finer Things Club.

101
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,436
My ex wife used to have a book
club and I would read their book

102
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,356
and sometimes listen
from the kitchen.

103
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,982
The Finer Things Club was not

104
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,443
sanctioned by the party
planning committee.

105
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,653
Renegade clubs are dangerous.

106
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,282
I squashed the Weight
Loss Buddy Support Group.

107
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,867
They didn't need to gather.

108
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,994
It was just gross.

109
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,330
- I don't know why I'm not
in the Finer Things Club.

110
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,416
It's bull crap.

111
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,460
(classical music plays)

112
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,463
- So, tell me again why I can't
be a part of your club.

113
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,548
- Because some people think
that you monopolize

114
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,342
the conversation
by trying to be funny.

115
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,345
- Oscar?
- Some people.

116
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,055
[Karen on phone] Hello?

117
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:48,765
- Fillippellers.
How they hanging?

118
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,850
- Michael...
- To the left? To the right?

119
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,228
- Listen, I'm...
- Okay, enough small talk.

120
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,313
- Go ahead.
- You called me.

121
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,066
Yes. Listen, umm...

122
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,652
You cannot tear Stanley
from his family like this.

123
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,987
- I'm pretty sure his family
is coming with him.

124
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,322
No, his work family.

125
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,449
Look, this is very hard for me,

126
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,493
but I'm going to give
you my best man.

127
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,078
You may have Toby.

128
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,579
Toby's not a salesperson.

129
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,831
You can train him.

130
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:16,543
He's very very smart and
funny and charming.

131
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,004
Aahhh!

132
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:20,505
You know, I can't do it.

133
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,965
Toby is the worst.

134
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,509
That was a bluff.

135
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,636
Listen, if you were going

136
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:29,014
to poach one of my guys, I am
going to poach one of yours.

137
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,306
Oooohhh...

138
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,475
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Okay. Goodbye.

139
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,144
Wait wait! Karen.

140
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,771
Could you transfer me to one
of your sales people, please?

141
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,023
Your best one.

142
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,566
(Karen hangs up)

143
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,031
- So, Stanley, are you
really out of here?

144
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,074
- Yep.
Looks that way.

145
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,077
I'm gonna miss you, man.

146
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,538
You've been like an uncle to me.

147
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,665
Like a kind old

148
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,459
Uncle Remus.

149
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,253
I want to stay in touch.

150
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:05,967
The Bernard Network or Bern-
network is constantly growing.

151
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,928
Always stay in touch with
everyone I've ever worked with.

152
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,765
Case in point, Stanley.
Just got his number.

153
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,518
1-800-Stanley.

154
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,688
How cool is it that he
got that number?

155
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,732
- If I was going
to socialize with Andy,

156
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,817
it would have happened by now.

157
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,945
- It's inappropriate
for Karen to poach Stanley.

158
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,865
Boiling makes
human flesh rubbery.

159
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,701
- I'm finally going
to get the good desk.

160
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,245
I have Ben Nugent on the line.

161
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,081
He is the top salesman in Utica.

162
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,583
- Hi, Ben. Michael Scott.
- Hi, Michael.

163
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,919
- I'm going to cut right
to the chase here.

164
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,629
Do you like magic?

165
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,714
Because I am a Genie in a bottle

166
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,716
and I'm going to grant you three
wishes.

167
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,760
To move to Scranton,

168
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,971
to have a great job
and to be my best friend.

169
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,641
- Aren't you the guy that hit
the woman with your car?

170
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,685
- (Pam chuckles)
- Get out.

171
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,980
Uhh...
Yeah, I also saved her life.

172
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,692
But I guess that's
not as grabby.

173
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,277
- Everyone says Scranton branch
is worse than Camden.

174
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,322
Didn't everyone from Stanford
quit, like immediately?

175
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,241
- No, I fired them.
And you're next.

176
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,663
So what do you say?

177
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,331
Seriously?

178
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:20,417
- What is that guy
talking about?

179
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,168
Scranton is not lame.

180
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,294
Here's the breakdown.

181
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,797
Utica is lame.

182
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,467
Utica is snoozeville.

183
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,803
Albany are the prepsters.

184
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,389
Umm...Camden is in a basement.

185
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,683
Nashua has no parking.

186
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,853
Akron is haunted.

187
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,896
Yonkers has the two hot girls.

188
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,692
And Scranton is the cool,
fun branch.

189
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,527
We're like Animal House.

190
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,821
- [Dwight] Found him.
(classical music plays)

191
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,324
Jim, we're getting crapped on.

192
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,743
Word is our branch sucks.

193
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,327
We have to do
something about it.

194
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,079
- So what are you going to do?
- What are we going to do?

195
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,165
We are going to make
a monster sale,

196
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,249
is what we're going to do.

197
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,001
- Corcoran dropped Staples.
- Did they?

198
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,753
- Yes, they did.
Oh, yes, they did.

199
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,963
And we are going to murder it.

200
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:09,799
You, me, Dwight are going
to jump in my PT Cruiser

201
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,843
we are going to crush this sale.

202
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,178
We are going to prove

203
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,472
what the hell is that music?

204
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,515
It's Vivaldi for Finer Things.

205
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,601
- That's the problem.
That's the problem.

206
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,394
We need rock and roll, Pam.

207
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,854
Rock and roll.

208
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,022
All right?

209
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,318
Oh, my God.

210
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,819
(classical music plays)

211
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,613
That's why people are leaving.

212
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:33,990
I...

213
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,160
I have no words.

214
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,287
**

215
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,253
Woo!

216
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,131
- Shotgun!
- Oh, you're driving, right?

217
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,926
- Yes, I am.
But I want shotgun for you.

218
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,260
- [Dwight] I wanted to
sit next to you.

219
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,513
- No, Dwight, Dwight, Jim is
sitting next to me.

220
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,889
You're going to sit in the back

221
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,891
left where I don't have
to see your ugly moon gob.

222
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,976
- Okay, that is so mean.
You know what?

223
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,353
- I'm not going.
- I'm sorry.

224
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,854
I'm sorry, Dwight.
You're handsome.

225
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,690
You're a very handsome man.
Get in the car.

226
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,360
(car door slams)

227
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,404
Woo hoo!

228
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,697
(car engine revs)

229
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,416
- We just passed the
exit for Corcoran.

230
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,126
What? What? We did?

231
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,921
[Dwight and Michael]
Surprise! Yaah!

232
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,047
Hahaha!

233
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,591
- Yes! Look at his face!
Look at his face.

234
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,844
- What are we doing?
- Egg dripping, blaah.

235
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,429
Dwight, what are we doing?

236
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,847
Well, Gee, Jim, I don't know.

237
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,724
I guess there's no
sales call today.

238
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,767
- We are going on a panty
raid to Utica.

239
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,728
Is what we're doing.

240
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,479
- We're going to Utica?
- Uh huh!

241
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,731
(Dwight laughs)

242
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm not going to Utica.

243
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,275
Yes, you are.

244
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,651
Oh, buckle up, Jim.

245
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,278
- No...
- We are going to make Karen

246
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,947
wish that she had
never been dumped by you.

247
00:10:55,989 --> 00:11:00,201
(Michael and Dwight chanting)
Utica! Utica! Utica!

248
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:08,043
- Yow!
- I can't believe you guys.

249
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,879
I'm not going to go further
and piss off my ex-girlfriend.

250
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,547
- Are you calling Karen?
- No, I'm not calling Karen.

251
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,091
- He's lying.
- Yeah, get it.

252
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,594
- What are you doing?
Stop it! Dwight!

253
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,387
Gah! Hah!

254
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,597
Are you kidding me?

255
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,515
No communication
with the outside world, Jim.

256
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,767
(Dwight laughs)

257
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,727
Had to be done.

258
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,562
- Well, that kind of
sucks because

259
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:29,939
it had all the photos of my
brother's new baby on it.

260
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,445
That is too bad.

261
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,446
Shoot.

262
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,208
- Okay.
- Hey, Dwight, he found it.

263
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,127
You know what? I'm just going
to call a cab from here.

264
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,337
All right.

265
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,006
- You'll miss the best prank ever.
- All right.

266
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,009
Wait.

267
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,427
What are you planning on doing?

268
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,472
Do you really want to know?

269
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,933
- Oh, God.
- Follow me. Come here.

270
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,101
Here's what we brought.

271
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,436
We brought uniforms
from the warehouse.

272
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,021
I brought silly string.

273
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,231
Dwight brought gasoline

274
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,941
and chunks of rubber
to make stink bombs.

275
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,902
- Or real bombs.
- No, no. Not real bombs.

276
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,987
- Come on.
It'll be so bad ass.

277
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,491
- Maybe. I don't know.
It could be bad ass.

278
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,868
- Well..
- No. Absolutely

279
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,370
we're not doing this.

280
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,871
- Come on, I already filled
the bottles with the gas.

281
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,499
- It's going to be so bad ass!
- Are you kidding me?

282
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:30,625
We've been driving around

283
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:31,960
with this in the trunk
the whole time?

284
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,837
- Teach her to offer
Stanley more money.

285
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,550
- Can you imagine a
life where all

286
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,219
you have to do is summer
in the Italian countryside?

287
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,721
I know, right?

288
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,391
I just want to go and look
at art and swim in the Adriatic.

289
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,727
- And spend time
with George Emerson.

290
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,895
- That's what I would do.
- Absolutely.

291
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,605
He is great.

292
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,982
Totally!

293
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:55,608
I mean, come on.
Such a free spirit.

294
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,068
What are you doing?

295
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:00,655
- Just came to discuss
my favorite E.M. Forster novel.

296
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,073
(Andy sighs)
Pam...

297
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,994
These finger sandwiches look
finger licking delicious.

298
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,538
- I'm sorry, Andy,
but this is a closed club.

299
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,836
The Finer Things Club is

300
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:17,130
the most exclusive
club in this office.

301
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,215
Naturally, it's
where I need to be.

302
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,842
The party planning committee is

303
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,845
my backup, and Kevin's
band is my safety.

304
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,388
Fine.

305
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,309
I'll just

306
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:35,523
sit here in the common area
and read my book,

307
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,234
which just happens to be the
very same book you're reading.

308
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,486
All right.

309
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,154
Just know you're not
in The Finer Things Club.

310
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,031
Why can't I be in a club?

311
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,533
So there was no sales call?

312
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,618
[Jim] No.

313
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,036
Turns out it was just a really

314
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,998
bad idea involving fire,
but I think I fixed it.

315
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,708
- Wait, you're going
along with this now?

316
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,793
I have to.

317
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,044
Pam, if I'm not there,

318
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,004
someone's going to go
to jail or die.

319
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,508
- Right. And you wouldn't be
able to talk to Karen.

320
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,760
- Well, I promise you, that
has nothing to do with it.

321
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,345
A little bit.

322
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,971
- Well, yeah, I don't want to
see her get physically harmed.

323
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,473
That's for sure.

324
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:10,141
- Because you love her?
Because you love her very much?

325
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,267
- All right.
I'm going to go now.

326
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,727
- Okay.
Have fun with your girlfriend!

327
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,062
Okay, I will.

328
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm kidding around.

329
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,315
We joke about that
stuff all the time.

330
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:19,067
I'm not really the jealous type,

331
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,236
so I don't care if
Jim sees Karen.

332
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,072
I care a little.

333
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:26,408
So the deal was

334
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:30,120
Dwight doesn't blow anything up,
and I wear costume.

335
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,373
And a mustache.

336
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:39,004
- So why did you
and Karen break up?

337
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,630
- Was it the sex?
- What?

338
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:43,008
- I can't imagine the sex being
bad. I mean her body...

339
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,926
- You know what?
Why don't we play that Alphabet

340
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:46,970
game that you were
talking about?

341
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,847
Okay, I will start.

342
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,223
Umm... "A".

343
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,227
* Hey, my name is Alan,
and my wife's name is Alice *

344
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,646
* We live in Alaska,
and we sell... *

345
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,859
Damn! What do we sell?
Umm...

346
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,110
Doesn't matter.

347
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,194
- I'm trying to think
of what we could sell.

348
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,571
It doesn't matter.

349
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,697
(liquid splashing)

350
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,115
What is that?

351
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:11,202
That sound. The air conditioning
leaking or something?

352
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,663
- That doesn't make sense.
It couldn't be.

353
00:15:13,705 --> 00:15:15,457
What is that?

354
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:17,292
(liquid splashing)

355
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:19,669
Dwight, are you peeing?

356
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,087
I'm peeing in this empty can.

357
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:23,631
- Oh, my God!
- Man, that is disgusting!

358
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:25,508
- You said we couldn't
make any more stops.

359
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,634
I really had to go.

360
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,844
- (car skids)
- Michael, watch the road!

361
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,137
Hey! You're making me spray!

362
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,472
- I'll kill you, man!
- Oh my God!

363
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,515
- Michael, Michael!
Pull over!

364
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,600
Disgusting!

365
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,934
- I think I cut
my penis on the lid.

366
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,437
- [Pam] I think it's interesting
how Forster uses

367
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,023
Italy to represent
sexuality and passion.

368
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:41,483
(coins clanking)

369
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:45,987
And that also brought up themes
of fate and coincidence.

370
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,323
And Lucy is torn between
these two things.

371
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,700
She's torn between
passion and convention.

372
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,327
[Kevin] Damn it.

373
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,787
(banging)

374
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,667
(loud banging)

375
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,795
(indistinct)

376
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,296
[Kevin] Yes!

377
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:07,634
Dammit.

378
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,511
(microwave beeps)

379
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,305
- Made him sort of ahead
of his time as a writer.

380
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,808
Very brave choice, I thought.

381
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:21,106
- And George, his youthfulness,
his freedom, evokes

382
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,732
(beeping)

383
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:24,943
feelings.

384
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,985
Umm...

385
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:28,279
(beep beep beep)

386
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,031
(shouting) What are you,
microwaving?

387
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,199
Popcorn.

388
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,158
- Why don't you use
the microwave

389
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,910
in the kitchen, Phyllis?

390
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,746
- Someone needs to clean it.
It smells like popcorn.

391
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:39,666
Okay.

392
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,419
(microwave whirring)

393
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,296
I think of the Finer Things Club

394
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,634
as a little flickering candle
that everyone in the office is

395
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:51,761
trying to blow out
with their bad breath.

396
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,098
- [Jim] I can't believe
we're here.

397
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,516
I can't believe
this is happening.

398
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,643
- [Dwight] Believe it.
- Afro wig?

399
00:16:58,685 --> 00:16:59,728
Do you want the afro wig?

400
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,438
- No, Michael, I'm not
leaving the car.

401
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,189
- You could be our getaway, man.
That's smart.

402
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,566
Keep the engine running.

403
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,818
- No, I am the "not
participating in any way" man.

404
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,945
- Come on!
- All right, Dwight.

405
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,155
Here's how it's
going to go down.

406
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,406
You and I...

407
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,908
(whispering)
Guy's going by. Shh,

408
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,493
You and I are going
to sneak inside.

409
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,911
We pretend that we are
warehouse workers.

410
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:19,497
And we will silly string the
bejesus out of the place.

411
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,082
- And if we have to defend
ourselves,

412
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,377
I will stab the security guard
in the eye with the jumbo chalk.

413
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,755
- No! No, you won't do that.
Nope.

414
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,132
- Then I'll grind up the jumbo
chalk and blow it in his eyes.

415
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:32,218
- Dwight, nothing
with the eyes, please.

416
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,763
Okay, Jim.

417
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,432
- Oh, my God. That's her.
That's her.

418
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,601
- Go go go go!
- Let's move! Move move move!

419
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,144
Shut up!

420
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,355
This is the dumbest
thing we've ever done.

421
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,120
- [Michael on radio] We are in
the stairwell.

422
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,789
- [Dwight] We are climbing
some stairs.

423
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,166
(heavy breathing)

424
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,834
- [Dwight] I am breathing
heavily.

425
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:06,544
- Okay, you know what?
You really don't need to be

426
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,171
updating me as much as
you're updating me.

427
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,339
- [Michael] There's a guy,
there's a guy.

428
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:10,590
- [Dwight] It's a security
guard coming by.

429
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,302
Hello. We're warehouse workers.

430
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,180
- Would you like more proof?
- [Guard] Hey.

431
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:19,391
- [Michael] Oh, my God.
That was very close.

432
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,101
- [Dwight] I can see the
security guard's eyes.

433
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,186
No, don't do anything to them!

434
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,313
- [Dwight] I have to do
something to his eyes.

435
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:28,358
The eyes are the groin
of the head.

436
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,528
- All right, Great Scott,
if you found that choking

437
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:32,737
hazard poster,
just head on home.

438
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,155
- [Michael] We got something
far better.

439
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:37,325
Their crown jewel.
They're industrial copier.

440
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,452
Isn't that thing huge?

441
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,455
- [Michael] It's enormous,
but it's got wheels.

442
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:45,333
We're wheeling it down
the hall into the stairwell.

443
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,128
Get the car ready.
Keep the engine running.

444
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,130
No, that is a terrible idea.

445
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,506
Don't do this.

446
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,258
- [Michael] Aahh!!!
(crashing sound)

447
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,801
[Dwight] My hip bone!

448
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,261
- [Michael] We're wedged between
the copier and the railing.

449
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,138
Ow! God! My leg!

450
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,849
- Leave us, Jim!
- Don't leave us!

451
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,018
- Save yourself!
- Don't leave us. Help us.

452
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,227
We need help, Jim.

453
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:06,187
- Okay, first of all,
stop using my name.

454
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,313
And second of all...

455
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,732
(Michael and Dwight arguing)

456
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,233
Damn it, guys.

457
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,276
Move over a little bit!

458
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,777
- I'm losing control
of my bladder!

459
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,779
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Karen is back.

460
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,240
- [Dwight] Is that Karen?
- [Michael] Take her to a motel.

461
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,867
Make love to her, Jim.

462
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,702
No, I'm not doing that.

463
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:22,412
- [Michael] Say you want to get
back together.

464
00:19:22,454 --> 00:19:23,913
No, I'm not doing that.

465
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,331
- [Michael] It doesn't have
to mean anything.

466
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,835
Just do it for Stanley.
Come on, Jim.

467
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:31,546
Just climb on top of her
and think about Stanley.

468
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:36,051
Oh, Jim, if this is it for me,
promise me something...

469
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,053
- (taps on window)
- Jim?

470
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,846
[Michael] Host the Dundies.

471
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,017
Hey, Karen.

472
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,897
- Uhh... What are you
doing here?

473
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,982
First of all, Hi.

474
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,359
What are you doing here?

475
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,777
You good?

476
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,072
I'm just checking
on the other branches.

477
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,491
Michael wants me to do
that from time to time, so...

478
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,326
[Michael] Jim!

479
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,827
That's Michael right there.
Hold on a sec.

480
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:06,498
Utica's all set.
I'm going to head on to Albany.

481
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,626
- [Michael](moaning)
There's a crow bar

482
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,796
in the trunk.
Bring in the crow bar.

483
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,881
Why are you here?

484
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:17,133
I'm the getaway driver.

485
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:21,012
- [Dwight] Do not tell Karen
about the industrial copier

486
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,222
Copy that.

487
00:20:23,014 --> 00:20:24,849
- I cried for weeks
over that guy.

488
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,852
So, yeah, seeing him
climb out of a PT Cruiser

489
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,731
in a lady's warehouse
uniform felt pretty good.

490
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,983
They sprayed me in the eye.

491
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,028
Scranton rules!

492
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,321
Stop it! Stop it!

493
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,240
(Dwight moans)

494
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,575
Can you help me, please?
I'm being crushed.

495
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:50,000
- And let me just add that as
a member of the Finer Things

496
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:55,422
Club, I would bring a strong
financial contribution to any

497
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,383
discretionary funds
that we may have.

498
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,260
Finally, here's a recommendation

499
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,555
from former
US Senator Rick Santorum.

500
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,056
Okay, that's enough.

501
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,599
Thanks, Andy.

502
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,272
He's going to ruin everything.

503
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:13,565
Oh, my God.

504
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,817
His letter of recommendation
from Rick Santorum

505
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:18,236
- is three fifty dollar bills.
- Wow.

506
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,238
Now we can afford
hardcover books.

507
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,781
I like it just us three.

508
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,827
I don't want it to change.

509
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,705
Let me ask you.

510
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,999
Did you accomplish
what you wanted?

511
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:33,918
- Listen, lady,
you can expect these kind

512
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,130
of repercussions as long as you
keep trying to poach our people.

513
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:38,465
I'm taking Stanley.

514
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:42,135
- And we will burn Utica
to the ground.

515
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,513
(Michael clears his throat)

516
00:21:45,555 --> 00:21:49,184
- Granted, maybe this
was not the best idea.

517
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,936
But at least we care enough

518
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:54,731
about our employees that we
are willing to fight for them.

519
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:59,652
And if you so much as harm
a hair on Stanley's head,

520
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,782
we will burn Utica
to the ground.

521
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,542
- Jim, hang on a second.
- Yes.

522
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,674
- So you're still doing
this kind of stuff, huh?

523
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,133
- Yeah.
Trying to quit, though.

524
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,844
If you wanted to see me,

525
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,971
you could have just
called me like an adult.

526
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:28,932
- Oh, no, I didn't
want to see you.

527
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,936
Not that I'm not happy to be
seeing you right now.

528
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,814
I'm just saying, ultimately,
I was here for the copier.

529
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:37,565
Equal. I'd say it was equal.

530
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,609
So, good to see you.

531
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,986
(phones ringing)

532
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,197
I mean, it's just that...
(clears throat)

533
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,075
You know, Pam and
I are still dating, so...

534
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,662
And I just mean that things
are going really well.

535
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,832
So I didn't want to see you.

536
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,751
- Oh, things are going
really well, are they?

537
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,879
They are? That's great.
That's so great.

538
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,507
I want to hear more about
how happy you are with Pam.

539
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,092
Can you tell me more about that?

540
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:07,512
Thank you so much for coming
to Utica and breaking my copier

541
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,348
and telling me how well things
are going in your relationship.

542
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,683
Really. Thank you.

543
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,727
- All right.
You are welcome.

544
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:18,523
I am going to go
because of traffic.

545
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:20,650
- Traffic. Yeah.
- So...

546
00:23:21,735 --> 00:23:24,237
- Go because of traff...
Definitely beat the traffic.

547
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,906
I will...

548
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:31,036
- I wasn't that mad at him,
but I needed time for Rolando

549
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,204
to put a scoop of tuna fish
in their glove compartment.

550
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,042
- Would it have killed you
to spend the afternoon making

551
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,961
love to her in a motel
room like I begged you to?

552
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,840
Pam would have understood.

553
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,383
Heck, Pam would have done it.

554
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,677
Pam is down for anything.

555
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:49,304
You embarrassed me.

556
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,015
You embarrassed us.

557
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,893
- Yeah, we should
have brought Andy.

558
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,065
I cut a chunk out
of my penis for nothing.

559
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,499
- Dear Andrew Bernard,
after carefully examining your

560
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,084
application to the
Finer Things Club.

561
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,378
We are unable to offer you a
position at this place in time.

562
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,921
We would, however,

563
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,757
like to place you on a list
in case an opportunity arises

564
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,801
when your inclusion
could be tolerated.

565
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,177
Your position as an ongoing

566
00:24:29,219 --> 00:24:32,430
financial patron, however,
is yours to cherish.

567
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,308
Sincerely,
The Finer Things Club.

568
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,727
Yes!
Woohoo!

569
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,771
Wait listed.

570
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:42,107
I got into Cornell
off the wait list.

571
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:45,110
I went to Germany and did
a photojournalism project called

572
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,445
the Berlin Wall
Several Years Later.

573
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,781
Has anything really changed?

574
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:51,366
They ate it up.

575
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,328
Also, my dad went there.

576
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,788
He was a big donor.

577
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,207
I lived in Bernard Hall
my freshman year.

578
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,167
So...

579
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:11,052
- (clears throat)
- We tried and we failed.

580
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,390
Stanley, you

581
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,393
may go.

582
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:21,938
Here is a box

583
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,983
for your things.

584
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,696
But I doubt that that box
will be able to contain

585
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,907
all the memories that you
have of this place.

586
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,701
(Michael sighs)

587
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:36,953
Fly away, sweet little bird.

588
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,205
Fly away and be free.

589
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,208
Pam...

590
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:45,086
I'm going to need some
help writing a want ad.

591
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,173
Umm...

592
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:50,884
Wanted...

593
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,720
Middle aged black man with sass.

594
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:57,223
Big butt, bigger heart.

595
00:25:57,891 --> 00:25:59,893
(knock on door)
I can't do this.

596
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,728
Michael?

597
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:03,813
A word?

598
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:06,274
Of course.

599
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,487
I changed my mind.

600
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,988
I want to keep this job.

601
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,367
- Really?
- Yes.

602
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,620
Because of the rapport we have

603
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:21,414
because of the family
that we have here?

604
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,084
- Yeah.
That's exactly the reason.

605
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,544
I wasn't really
planning on leaving.

606
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:28,546
All I wanted was a raise.

607
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:31,091
How on Earth did
Michael call my bluff?

608
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:34,552
Is he some sort
of secret genius?

609
00:26:34,594 --> 00:26:36,429
(Stanley chuckles)

610
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,890
Sometimes I say crazy things.

611
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,604
Hey.

612
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:47,774
- I'm so sorry.
Rolando told me everything.

613
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,027
How humiliating.

614
00:26:52,153 --> 00:26:55,156
Would it help you
to return to another age?

615
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:59,953
A time of refinement
and civility?

616
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,206
Are you inviting me
to the Finer Things Club?

617
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:04,833
(Andy gasps)

618
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:06,459
Oh, come on!

619
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,592
Frankie's prose is finer
than a pot of gold.

620
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,177
Say I.

621
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,762
Okay.

622
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:20,140
Did you get it out
of your system?

623
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,558
Yup.

624
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,853
No, I mean, I really liked it.
Thought it was a fun read.

625
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:26,730
Fun? Really?

626
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:29,149
- Yeah.
- What was fun about it for you?

627
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,942
Was it the death of the twins?

628
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,989
No, that wasn't fun.

629
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:37,699
Did you even read it?

630
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,908
Of course I read it.

631
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,035
[Oscar] How does it end?

632
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,453
Who's the main character?

633
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,748
Angela.

634
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,124
Nope.

635
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,542
Ashes.

636
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,926
(upbeat music)
