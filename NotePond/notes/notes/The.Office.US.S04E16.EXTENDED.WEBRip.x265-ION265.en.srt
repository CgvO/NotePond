1
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:13,722
Everybody?

2
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,224
Everybody, listen up,
I need your ideas now.

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,517
Ideas please, right now.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,144
Go, go, come on.

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,478
- Michael, we don't know
what you're talking about.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,981
- Wet cement outside,
it's drying fast come on.

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,482
This is a lifelong dream.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,276
What do I write? What do I
write?

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,986
- Michael, you can put
your initials in it.

10
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,154
- M-G-S, no.

11
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:33,033
Some idiot named Mark Greg
Sputnik

12
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,617
will claim credit for it, don't
know...

13
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:35,744
That is true.

14
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,661
- Once a lifetime opportunity
people.

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,746
Come on here we go.

16
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:38,538
- [Phyllis] Well but-
- Here we go.

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,789
- Well-
- [Michael] Yes?

18
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,166
When I was a little girl.

19
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,542
[Michael] Okay.

20
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,418
(Phyllis giggles)

21
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,252
Okay, tell us.

22
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,295
Go on great, let's hear it.

23
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,671
We found some wet cement

24
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,340
- It's drying, it's drying,
- in the park

25
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,549
at our neighborhood and...

26
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,592
All right!

27
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,135
- Come on Phyll!
- What did we write?

28
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:52,969
(Michael shouting)

29
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,012
Come on!

30
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,055
- Here it is, you draw a
picture.

31
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,014
No.

32
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:57,098
- Cause that's says-
- No!

33
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:57,849
- That says so much more than
words.

34
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,892
- No!
- The picture.

35
00:00:58,933 --> 00:00:59,642
- Come on, give me something
good!

36
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,977
Okay, I was watching E!

37
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,604
and I saw Will Smith
outside the Chinese Theater

38
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,522
and oh my God, he looked so
good.

39
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,607
Pam translate?

40
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,691
- She's talking about the hand
prints

41
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:07,984
that celebrities make in the
cement.

42
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,361
I love it!

43
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,653
- If you were a real star
you'd put your face in it.

44
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,696
I love it more!

45
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,198
- Michael that doesn't seem
safe.

46
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,325
I love it!

47
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,953
- Come on, lets go.
- [Dwight] Come on!

48
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,539
(Dwight laughing)
(running)

49
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,709
- We are here today not
to immortalize a man

50
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,585
but an idea.

51
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,962
Maybe the idea of a man,

52
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,339
Hurry please.

53
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,591
- Greatness is only skin
deep some people say-

54
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,884
- Can you breathe?
- Well that's not true.

55
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,010
Other people believe it's deeper
outside.

56
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:34,886
Hold your breath.

57
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:35,845
- In this case-
- Ready?

58
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,556
- That's also not true.
- And,

59
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,432
Go.

60
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,267
Force in as deep as you can.

61
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,061
- (mumbling) That's what she
said.

62
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,480
Today's a very special day for
me,

63
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,940
and it's really not about me

64
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,610
it's about my grandkids, it's
about my great grandkids.

65
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,405
I can come back here when I'm
100

66
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,117
and I can find that
piece of cement and say,

67
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,410
"That's me.

68
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,287
"Look kids, your daddy
left that face hole."

69
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,290
I don't know, it's a good
feeling.

70
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,253
Whoa!

71
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,922
(trash can falling)
(Meredith sighs)

72
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,467
Upbeat theme song

73
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:33,737
Okay.

74
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,612
Adjective.

75
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,615
Tall.

76
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,575
No, no.

77
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,035
Nice.

78
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,119
Good one.

79
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,078
Okay.

80
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,954
You ready?

81
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,289
{\an8}- Mm-hmm.

82
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,376
{\an8}- The tall man entered the nice
building

83
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:53,214
{\an8}to visit a very nice man.

84
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,425
{\an8}Sit down Mr. Smith,

85
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,637
{\an8}could I interest you in any good
cat food?

86
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,513
{\an8}(Angela laughs)

87
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,475
{\an8}It's a man eating cat food.

88
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,643
{\an8}- How about a cat eating man
food?

89
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,354
{\an8}(Andy meows)

90
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:10,440
{\an8}(Andy pretend-chewing)

91
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:13,026
{\an8}This hamburger's delicious.

92
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,319
{\an8}(Angela laughs)

93
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,988
{\an8}- A cat eating a hamburger
sandwich?

94
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,947
That's impossible.

95
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,449
I know.

96
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,201
- Where do you think of these
things?

97
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,535
Honestly, I don't know.

98
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,662
{\an8}- Andy and Andrew seem very
happy.

99
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,873
{\an8}I hope nothing horrible
ever happens to them.

100
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:39,135
{\an8}- Yeah, I slept over
at a friend's house and

101
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,513
{\an8}I forgot my contact solution so,

102
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,390
{\an8}I had to wear my backup glasses.

103
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:47,143
{\an8}Shut up.

104
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,020
{\an8}Alright, everybody.

105
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,855
Oh my God, Pam.

106
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,400
Those make you look so ugly.

107
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,444
{\an8}Pam, in order to get hotter,
you take glasses off.

108
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,446
{\an8}You're moving in the wrong
direction.

109
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,781
I don't have my contacts.

110
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,242
- (babbling) I can't even hear
you.

111
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,453
It's just noise coming
out of an ugly scientist.

112
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,622
Everybody, we're going to have a
little,

113
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,083
a brainstorming session
in the conference room.

114
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,794
Energize.

115
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,587
- You know what would energizes
me?

116
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,049
If you Pamela Morgan Beesly-

117
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,342
- Don't you dare.
- Would take-

118
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,969
- If you propose to me
during the micro meeting,

119
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,220
I will say, no.

120
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,305
- Well, it's too late
because I'm proposing

121
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,807
that you get me a cup of coffee,

122
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,559
which would energize me and
greatly

123
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,102
and make me the happiest man in
the world.

124
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,479
- Everybody, so how are we going
to

125
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,815
energize our office?

126
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:36,526
I mean, I haven't done
anything since Christmas.

127
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,071
Pam clearly has just given up
trying.

128
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,905
Pam stand up.

129
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,243
Hi everyone.

130
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,579
My name is Pam and I wear
glasses.

131
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,371
Hi Pam.

132
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,372
Pretty disgusting.

133
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,331
So what we need to do (Jim
claps)

134
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,541
is we need to get things going.

135
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,917
We need to get percolating a
little bit.

136
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,920
Anybody have any ideas what we
could do?

137
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,172
Any suggestions?

138
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,257
Oscar start us off, what do we
got?

139
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,175
I don't know.

140
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,760
Every idea is a good idea.

141
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,428
- A new color scheme
for the entire office.

142
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,388
Bad idea, I mean,

143
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,682
no, you know what?

144
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,642
That's a good idea but it
would be bad if we did it.

145
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,518
Yes, Andy.

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,519
We've changed our

147
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,314
outgoing answering machine
message.

148
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,107
So it just had a little more

149
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,234
zing and a little more pep.

150
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,569
Zing and pep.

151
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,820
See those are the kinds of
words we're looking for.

152
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,238
Yes, Jim?

153
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,574
- What about it we did an
even newer voicemail message

154
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,534
that had even more zing and pep.

155
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:27,827
Now we're cooking.

156
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,037
I like this.

157
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,164
Maybe a whole theme,
like a rap, a rap rhyme.

158
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,457
An urban thing.

159
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,168
- Yeah Stanley, you wanna
help us out with that?

160
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,753
Stanley, earth to Stanley.

161
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:37,462
Not me.

162
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,296
Yes, you.

163
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,506
Come on, Stanley.

164
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,925
Put your little game
down and join the group.

165
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:42,801
No.

166
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,177
Stanley,

167
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,470
Leave me alone, damn it.

168
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,097
- we're having a brainstorm
session.

169
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,515
Did I stutter?

170
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,941
- Good, this is good, I'm
going to grab a glass of water.

171
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:06,825
- It looks like somebody's
got a case of man-apause.

172
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,036
It's like menopause, but for
men.

173
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,622
What?

174
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,040
Then I could just say menopause.

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,459
Wait...

176
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,544
you know what I mean?

177
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,838
Michael versus Stanley.

178
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,131
Oh please.

179
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,008
The only battle worth
watching in this office

180
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,384
is me versus me.

181
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,428
Oh, that'd be a good one.

182
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,887
Evenly matched.

183
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,849
But I can take on anyone, even
myself.

184
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,891
(sighs)

185
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,727
We would fight, it would be
intense.

186
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:37,063
But in the end there'd only be
one winner,

187
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:37,897
Dwight Schrute.

188
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:39,899
The loser?

189
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,708
(Stanley coughs)

190
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,464
Can I talk to you a second?

191
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,924
(groans) What?

192
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,844
- I really think that you need
to address

193
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,597
what happened with Stanley this
morning.

194
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:11,848
What are you blabbering about?

195
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,183
Nothing happened.

196
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,227
- Well, you know, Stanley
was openly insubordinate.

197
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,479
That in the conference room?

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,813
[Toby] Yeah.

199
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,483
- We were Josh and around the
two of us

200
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,401
and he said, "Did I stutter?"

201
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,321
And I said, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what dog?

202
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,907
He was joking, Toby alright?

203
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,368
- He didn't seem like he was
joking.

204
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,120
- Well, you don't get it
because Stanley is a beautiful,

205
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,456
sassy, powerful black man.

206
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,708
And you're you.

207
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,378
If you had any friends
you would understand

208
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,921
friends joke with one another.

209
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,173
"Hey, you're poor."

210
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,384
"Well, hey, your mama's dead."

211
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,511
That's what friends do.

212
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,428
It's...

213
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,263
you're so white.

214
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,140
By talking back to me,

215
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,601
Stanley was really saying

216
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,145
you're not paying attention to
me, dad.

217
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,563
I want to act out.

218
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,107
I understand this because

219
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,567
that's exactly what I
did when I was a kid.

220
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,945
Did it make my dad leave?

221
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,029
Maybe.

222
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,657
But Stanley can never make me
leave

223
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,617
because I have a contract.

224
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,119
Alright.

225
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,040
Well, if you really believe
that Stanley was joking,

226
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,543
why don't we go ask him them?

227
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,836
Okay I will.

228
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,672
I'm not feeling very
well right now though.

229
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,717
My stomach hurts so I may be
going home early today, but...

230
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,094
You know Michael,

231
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,595
sometimes my daughter's stomach
hurts

232
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,097
when there's a mean girl at
school.

233
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,348
Well, sometimes

234
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,768
my stomach hurts when
you come into my office.

235
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,688
So it's probably psychological.

236
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,566
(phone ringing)

237
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,029
Stanley is one of my oldest
friends in this office.

238
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,741
He outweighs me by a hundred
pounds.

239
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,661
He's the type of friend that
I could not see for 50 years

240
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,705
and the second I saw him,

241
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:03,710
I could make an insult about
his mama and he would laugh

242
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,171
and I would laugh,

243
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,091
and I'd say, "You're one
of my oldest friends."

244
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,677
And I think he gets choked up
inside

245
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,347
because he'd want to say,

246
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,349
"Hey, Michael, I love you, man.

247
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,225
"You're one of my oldest
friends.

248
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,437
"And did you hear Jim died?"

249
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,313
And I'd be like, "What?

250
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,689
"How?"

251
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:29,027
"Of a broken heart because
did you hear Pam died?"

252
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,529
That's the kind of friends we
are.

253
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,742
50 years from now, we'll still
be talking about this office.

254
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:37,494
We'll still be laughing.

255
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,912
We'll still be crying.

256
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,915
We'll still be enjoying

257
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,462
and not enjoying all of the
things that happened here

258
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,672
and all the deaths.

259
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,218
It's nice.

260
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,721
I like your frames.

261
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,140
Thanks Phyllis, yours too.

262
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,225
I'm already married.

263
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,187
Boys don't make passes at
girls who wear glasses.

264
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,067
- Ignore her those glasses are
so cool.

265
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,528
Really?

266
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,987
- Yeah, you look like Lisa
Loeb or Tina Fey or someone.

267
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,073
You should definitely
wear them all the time.

268
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:15,740
Oh.

269
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:16,908
Maybe I will.

270
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,788
- Guess who just became the
cutest girl in the office?

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,043
- You meet a lot of
ladies driving an Xterra

272
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,629
because you pull up to a
stoplight and look over

273
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,548
and there's an Xterra next to
you,

274
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,591
they're always driven by chicks.

275
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,427
So there's your icebreaker.

276
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,970
(kicks)

277
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,263
Scratch.

278
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,265
That's a racing stripe.

279
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,725
Bumper sagging.

280
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,851
I doubt that very much.

281
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,227
(side windows flapping)

282
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,273
Very astute of you, the
mirrors are hinge jointed.

283
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,190
Yeah, I know.

284
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:50,275
I'm not an okie off the street.

285
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,152
I know how mirrors work.

286
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,570
Well, I'm just saying.

287
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,321
She's a very good in a crash.

288
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,574
I've been in four major
accidents, no injuries,

289
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,159
at least to my body.

290
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,995
Alright, start her up.

291
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,830
Let's see what you got under
here.

292
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:09,085
- Yeah well, 350 CCs of
screaming power.

293
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,796
Pos-attraction belt drive,
turbo.

294
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,298
Four on the floor, three on the
tree.

295
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,133
That doesn't make any sense.

296
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,968
- I'm gonna be honest with you
Dwight.

297
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,096
I don't know diddly about cars.

298
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:22,098
- Well thank you for telling me
that.

299
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,518
I will try and forget it
when I negotiate with you.

300
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,853
That's very decent of you.

301
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,146
This car is crap.

302
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,190
I will buy it for next to
nothing.

303
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,066
How next to?

304
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,525
Well, here are your options.

305
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,569
You can sell it for parts,

306
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,404
drive it off a cliff.

307
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,864
You can donate it

308
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,657
to a person that you'd like
to see die in a car crash,

309
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,118
or you can sell it to me

310
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,496
and I'll use it as I would
have wagon on my farm.

311
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,997
It'll be towed by a donkey.

312
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,665
I have to pick one of those?

313
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:48,833
Yes.

314
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:49,751
- Can you go over those options
again?

315
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,002
Yeah you know what?

316
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,755
You knock $1,500 off the price
right now

317
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,465
and I will take it off your
hands.

318
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,341
It's gotta be now.

319
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:57,217
Well, I have-

320
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,343
Seal the deal.

321
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,010
- The Blue Book Value's
- Let's do it.

322
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,303
Let's do this thing.

323
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,305
Three, two, one.

324
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,266
- Can I think about it?
- Five, four, three two, now.

325
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,184
Now!

326
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,185
Now, say it,

327
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,228
do it now.

328
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,396
Do it now.

329
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,313
Do it.

330
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,106
Shake my hand.

331
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:11,856
You will sell me this car.

332
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:12,732
Shake my hand.

333
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,525
Yeah!

334
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,734
Alright.

335
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,992
- I was just checking the
weather.

336
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,707
What?

337
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,418
- I see that you gave me that
form

338
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:34,671
that I asked you to give
me Stanley the manly.

339
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,381
So thank you for that.

340
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,008
I guess we are back to normal.

341
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,718
What are you talking about?

342
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,885
Well,

343
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,721
you know the thing that you said
earlier

344
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,098
that you didn't mean,

345
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,892
and that I forgive you for.

346
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,436
The whole thing is silly, isn't
it?

347
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,272
Friends don't need to apologize
to friends

348
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,273
as far as I'm concerned.

349
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,315
So we are cool.

350
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,901
- I am not going to apologize to
you.

351
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,195
It's like I used to tell my
wife,

352
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,032
I do not apologize
unless I think I'm wrong.

353
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,950
And if you don't like it,
you're going to leave.

354
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,578
And I say at the same
thing to my current wife.

355
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,039
And I'll say it to my next one
too.

356
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,832
- By the way, you didn't
stutter.

357
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:11,958
So don't feel bad.

358
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,335
You sounded very powerful.

359
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,462
- Go back to your office
and leave me alone.

360
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:18,965
Well, thanks for the form.

361
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,178
Man my stomach is killing me.

362
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,307
You know, I don't ask
very much of my employees.

363
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:28,892
I let 'em goof off.

364
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,852
I let 'em come in late.

365
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,854
I never put my foot down.

366
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,148
I let them walk all over me.

367
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:37,692
And what do I ask in return?

368
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,111
Nothing but their respect.

369
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,990
(Dwight scatting)

370
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,700
Oh, what's Dwight up to?

371
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,869
Oh, probably nothing.

372
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,579
(Dwight scatting)

373
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,374
(Dwight exclaims)

374
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,167
The hell is this all about?

375
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,046
You're flipping my car for
profit.

376
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:59,964
It's my car now.

377
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,511
- I gave you a deal based
on what you said to me.

378
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,764
Yeah well, seller beware.

379
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:08,973
Now if you'll excuse me,

380
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,517
I've got a monitor a three-way
bidding war

381
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,060
for my car on eBay.

382
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,855
I've got a Mad Lib for you.

383
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:21,653
A stupid idiotic numbskull
named Andy Bernard

384
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:27,534
sold his Xterra to a smart
and capable man named Dwight.

385
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,914
This is shaping up to be
an awesome day for Dwight.

386
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,002
- You know, I don't
care what he did to me.

387
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,045
He's mean to other people
that's what gets me it's just-

388
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,256
Who else does he mean to?

389
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,007
Everybody.

390
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,466
He's just, he's always,

391
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:46,678
he's always talking about
people behind their backs to me.

392
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,221
- What kind of stuff does
Stanley say?

393
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,015
Like the people are stupid

394
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,518
and that they're idiots
and that they're sluts.

395
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,853
Why would he say that?

396
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,021
Because he's mean.

397
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,982
He's like a really mean spirited
guy.

398
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:03,486
He talks about how gay Oscar is

399
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:08,491
and that Angela's a midget
and that your chin is too big.

400
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:10,452
- Hey-

401
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:11,536
I know, I know.

402
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,495
I think it's tiny.

403
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,998
I think it's too small of
anything

404
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,417
and that your glasses make you
look ugly.

405
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,003
- She's never worn these glasses
before.

406
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:21,504
Well, he's just mean.

407
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,424
- Michael, I think that what
Stanley did to you was rude.

408
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,009
Maybe you should just get them
aside

409
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,595
and tell him that he was
behaving badly.

410
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:29,554
It's complicated, Pam.

411
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,723
I mean, world looks a lot easier

412
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,892
from behind your reception desk.

413
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,768
- Well, actually I agree with
her.

414
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,227
I think you should talk to him

415
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,937
and you also might want to
explain to Andy

416
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,189
that no one wants to help him
decide

417
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,899
whether or not he has a rash.

418
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,192
Oh yeah.

419
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,193
And then yell at Creed
because you know what?

420
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,819
Looking can be as bad as
touching.

421
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:49,783
Okay. (Michael sighs)

422
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:54,704
What Stanley is doing right
now is called displacement.

423
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,166
Basically, Jan taught me this.

424
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,169
Displacement is when someone is

425
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:05,090
very, very angry about
something in their life,

426
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,258
but they take it out on me.

427
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,595
And so they're,

428
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:11,596
that's displacement.

429
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,599
- Do you need me to go
over this org chart again?

430
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,433
No.

431
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,601
Yes.

432
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,394
So Stanley reports to Jim.

433
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:18,520
Yes.

434
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,814
The people in this office crave
order,

435
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,693
otherwise nothing gets done
or worse yet, they'll revolt.

436
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:28,113
The last thing I need is
Michael's head on a spike.

437
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,282
The last thing I'd want is
to have to put it there.

438
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,660
- And Jim is in charge
of disciplining Stanley.

439
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,245
No.

440
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,123
Jim is in charge of Stanley
only in sales related matters.

441
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:38,957
Hence the green line.

442
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,833
Green for money.

443
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,001
Sales, get it.

444
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:42,585
There is this yellow zigzag

445
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:45,296
that does give Ryan the
authority to discipline Stanley.

446
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,631
Great.

447
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:49,134
- However, in so doing,
it zigs past your name,

448
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,761
hence zagging, you and
making you appear weak.

449
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,221
That's the yellow color.

450
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,848
Yellow for cowardly.

451
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,682
What's the pink?

452
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,018
Menstrual cycles.

453
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,561
Okay.

454
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,979
Is there anybody up here,

455
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:03,565
anybody at all that can deal
with this?

456
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,650
- You.
- Other than me.

457
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,612
- Well, there is the
emergency disaster mode

458
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,156
for the org chart.

459
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,242
This gives me full authority

460
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,995
over every single person in the
office.

461
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:17,996
- I never said you could do
that.

462
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,080
All you have to do is say it.

463
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:19,998
Just say it.

464
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,915
Okay I'll think about it.

465
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,667
Say it, just do it.

466
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,044
Don't think, say it.

467
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,003
Do it.

468
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:27,839
Five, four, three, two.

469
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,798
Do it.

470
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,551
It give me control, Michael.

471
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,681
I promise to give authority back
to you

472
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,807
when this crisis is over.

473
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:40,226
Do it, Michael.

474
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,146
Do it.

475
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,274
Hey, this office needs a strong
man.

476
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:48,777
Say it.

477
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,571
No.

478
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:54,741
Alright well,

479
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,078
you're going to have to
deal with this yourself.

480
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,920
Hi Pam.

481
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,922
I really like your glasses.

482
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,507
Oh, thanks.

483
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,592
- All the girlfriends that I've
ever had

484
00:18:12,634 --> 00:18:14,177
have a worn glasses.

485
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,012
Oh, okay.

486
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,931
- It's kind of a turn on for me
actually-

487
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,057
- I should probably get back to-

488
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,225
Like librarians.

489
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,601
- Entering the-

490
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,520
Could you just say,

491
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,188
"These are due back Thursday?"

492
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,022
No.

493
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,241
(phone rings)

494
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,952
(phone lifting)

495
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:40,662
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

496
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:42,997
Okay, go ahead.

497
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,003
A lot of jazz cats are blind,

498
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,839
but they can play the piano
like nobody's business.

499
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,050
I'd like to put the piano in
front of Pam

500
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,177
without her glasses and see what
happens.

501
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:58,763
I'd also like to see her
topless.

502
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,975
- Stanley, when you said
that mean thing to me

503
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,477
about you not stuttering,
it hurt my feelings.

504
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,979
And then when you would not
apologize,

505
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,397
it hurt my feelings as well.

506
00:19:07,439 --> 00:19:09,816
So I am asking you as a buddy

507
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,943
to just say that you did not
mean it.

508
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:14,988
Did you hear me?

509
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:15,822
Yes.

510
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,576
This is a letter of reprimand.

511
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,161
This is a terrible, terrible
thing.

512
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,247
And it pains me to have even
written this

513
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,376
because I know how detrimental
this can be to a career,

514
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:30,378
to a person psychologically.

515
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,713
This can destroy a life.

516
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,883
This is your personal file.

517
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,634
What happens next is up to you.

518
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,552
Will you apologize?

519
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,054
I will not.

520
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,057
- Then you leave me no other
choice.

521
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:44,851
I've put Stanley on a
pedestal for a long time,

522
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:48,104
but sometimes he can
just be a big fat jerk.

523
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,817
Jerks don't deserve to be on
pedestals.

524
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,112
Jerks should be placed up
somewhere

525
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:57,822
where everybody can
see how jerky they are.

526
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:01,034
Big, big marble jerk stand.

527
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,580
When this goes into your file,

528
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,124
it is there for all of eternity.

529
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,293
There is no way that
I can get it back out.

530
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,629
Do you understand that I
am still holding onto it?

531
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,676
I can retrieve it much
like playing checkers.

532
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,138
So this is your last chance
Stanley, will you apologize?

533
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,972
Nope.

534
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:26,476
(envelope drops)

535
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,894
- It is done.
- Fine, I'm going back to work.

536
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,229
Wait, wait, wait Stanley.

537
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,523
Stanley, I have written a second
letter.

538
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,066
Goodbye.

539
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,568
This letter claims that this
first letter is crazy talk.

540
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,820
I've decided

541
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,613
not to wear my glasses
for the rest of the day.

542
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,989
I'm not vain.

543
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,866
It's just, as soon as
I took my glasses off,

544
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,702
I felt instantly calmer.

545
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,995
I'll show you.

546
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:48,748
Unfocus your lens like a lot.

547
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,709
I have 20/400 vision.

548
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:55,755
Okay, so now I no longer
have to watch Dwight

549
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,716
pulling hairs out of his face.

550
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:02,929
And I can no longer see Creed

551
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:06,975
doing whatever it is Creed does.

552
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,148
I don't wanna know.

553
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:21,031
Mike, very busy here man.

554
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:25,368
- Darryl, have you ever been in
a gang?

555
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,536
Why?

556
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,204
It's an advice question,

557
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,123
and if you don't wanna talk
about it,

558
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:32,083
I completely understand it's-

559
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:33,752
No, no, no.

560
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,711
- I know it's very, very
personal.

561
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:35,754
No.

562
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:38,757
I have.

563
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:39,632
I knew it.

564
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:40,467
Okay.

565
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,261
What are we talking about here?

566
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:44,304
Crips, Bloods?

567
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,180
Both.

568
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,056
God.

569
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,807
Yeah them and the Latin Kings.

570
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:49,642
The Warriors.

571
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:50,518
Okay.

572
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,436
Newsies.

573
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:53,355
Okay, so dig this.

574
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,901
You're on the street and
one of your gang disses you.

575
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:58,985
Oh my goodness.

576
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,237
- Right and you know that he
feels bad

577
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,865
and that he wants to apologize
but he's embarrassed.

578
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,033
Well I mean he's in the gang.

579
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:06,242
Right, so what do you do?

580
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,621
I mean, short of going medieval
on his ass

581
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,247
or formally writing him up,

582
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,708
what do you do to get
him to make it right?

583
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,336
Well see, in the gang world.

584
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,381
We use something called fluffy
fingers.

585
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:21,883
What is that?

586
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:24,552
That's where somebody
really gets in your face.

587
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,138
You just start tickling 'em.

588
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,684
Really?

589
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,269
- Yeah and he starts tickling
you.

590
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,939
Pretty soon you laughing and
hugging.

591
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,899
Before you know it, you've
forgotten the whole thing,

592
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:39,984
Y'all could just go to church
together

593
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,945
and get ice cream cones.

594
00:22:41,986 --> 00:22:44,531
- I would have never thought
that

595
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,701
gangs would be tickling each
other.

596
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:49,577
Oh, it's effective.

597
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,915
- It's funny because this
is not the image of gangs

598
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:55,834
that most white people have.

599
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,210
This is telling you,

600
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,046
think we could learn a lot
from listening to this.

601
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:01,881
- I'm glad I could open your
eyes.

602
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:07,387
(weird noises)

603
00:23:08,513 --> 00:23:09,305
Fluffy fingers.

604
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:13,852
(car approaching)

605
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:16,563
(tires screeching)

606
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:19,566
(rustling)

607
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,776
(door opening)

608
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:22,610
Yo!

609
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,821
Hi, can I help you?

610
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,698
- Ha-ha nice.

611
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,283
I guess I have been a stranger
lately.

612
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:29,117
Ryan.

613
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,660
Hey Pam, you want a bagel?

614
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:32,078
- Yeah.
- Think fast.

615
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,080
Honestly Pam, the bagels in New
York

616
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:36,499
are the only good bagels in
the world I swear to God.

617
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,834
Okay.

618
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,044
- The only good bagels anywhere.
- I've heard that.

619
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,920
Same with coffee and women.

620
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:42,964
Okay.

621
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,758
I'm gonna go find Toby.

622
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,967
Oh, here's what you do.

623
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,512
Scoop out the middle like that.

624
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:50,221
And then you just eat the shell.

625
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:53,475
You know, fewer carbs.

626
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,894
(bag rustling)

627
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,812
- Yeah, if I could have
seen what he just did

628
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,397
I think I would've gotten angry.

629
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,733
- I think it's self-explanatory.

630
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:03,735
Hey Jim, come here for a second.

631
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:07,280
Can you answer me something
as a true Eagles fan?

632
00:24:07,322 --> 00:24:08,907
Oh boy.

633
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,034
How do you live with
the franchise this bad?

634
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,869
- On a wing and a prayer,
mostly.

635
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,287
Alright, whatever you say.

636
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:16,706
Listen, while I have you here
with Toby,

637
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:17,707
I need to give you a formal
warning

638
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,084
about your job performance.

639
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:20,960
A formal warning?

640
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,045
(chuckles)

641
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:23,797
It's actually not a joke.

642
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,215
I know how you spend your time
here.

643
00:24:25,256 --> 00:24:27,717
And I know how little
you care about your job.

644
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:28,927
And honestly,

645
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,428
if you spend as much
time selling as you do

646
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,889
goofing around with Dwight
and hanging out at reception,

647
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,933
we wouldn't be having this
conversation.

648
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,435
I'm sorry,

649
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,229
is this because I talked to
Wallace about your website

650
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,398
because I really didn't
mean to go over your head.

651
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:43,858
- This has nothing to
do with that, alright?

652
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,193
I have always appreciate

653
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,362
constructive criticism
about my job performance,

654
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:48,279
I thrive on it.

655
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:50,824
- I'm sorry, then do you mind
explaining it a little better

656
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,075
cause I'm not sure what's
really.

657
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:54,452
- Whoa don't get all defensive,
alright?

658
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:56,079
It's just a warning.

659
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,914
If you want the details,
Toby can provide 'em.

660
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,207
You take it easy alright?

661
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,169
(fingers tapping)

662
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:09,592
- Jim filled my desk with
marshmallows.

663
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:11,011
Ryan's serious.

664
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:13,888
I know because he called
me at five in the morning

665
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,223
last night to tell me.

666
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,559
Talked for an hour straight.

667
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:22,439
He also said that he thinks
the moon landing was faked

668
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,691
and girls don't know
prize when they see one.

669
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,620
It's not Darryl's fault.

670
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,164
It was a great idea.

671
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,334
I just couldn't figure out quite
how to do it, I don't know.

672
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,171
I have tried everything, man.

673
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,089
I'm just running out of options.

674
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,218
A formal warning, seriously?

675
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,511
Well, as you know,

676
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:55,638
Dwight has filed a lot
of complaints against you

677
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,514
over the years.

678
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:57,640
And no one cared.

679
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:58,933
But now it's being looked at

680
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:01,019
as more of a productivity issue.

681
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:01,895
Productivity?

682
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,313
My numbers are good.

683
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:08,109
- I know but Ryan thinks
that they're not good enough.

684
00:26:09,527 --> 00:26:12,322
I'd say all the goofing
around at Pam's desk

685
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:16,201
and hanging out with Pam has
finally caught up to him.

686
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:18,620
Pick with Pam.

687
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,998
Wallace likes Jim.

688
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,208
So going after him,

689
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,251
that's a risky move for me.

690
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,171
But in business, you got to take
risks.

691
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,799
Sometimes you got to get
out on the open highway

692
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,716
with the top down.

693
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,429
(mechanism struggling)

694
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:41,559
(car top opening)

695
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:47,607
(mechanism struggling)

696
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:50,485
(tires screeching)

697
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:54,197
Hey, what happened?

698
00:26:54,239 --> 00:26:55,699
What did Ryan want?

699
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,117
Oh, we were just.

700
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,786
Talking about bureaucratic
stuff.

701
00:26:59,828 --> 00:27:01,788
Because you're very important?

702
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,622
Yeah.

703
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:15,135
Stupid eBay.

704
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,554
Who buys a car on eBay?

705
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,556
- I've had a lot of success on
eBay.

706
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,141
Everything I'm wearing right
now.

707
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:22,434
I got on eBay.

708
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,476
Everything.

709
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,522
Good for you.

710
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:30,191
(ruler tapping)

711
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:34,696
(cash register mimicking)

712
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,540
(door opening)

713
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:47,792
Okay, everybody, shh.

714
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:52,255
So earlier today, Stanley sassed
me.

715
00:27:52,297 --> 00:27:54,215
And Toby gave me some
suggestions

716
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,633
on how to discipline him.

717
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,345
They did not work, obviously
because they were stupid.

718
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:02,932
So I am now going to fake fire
him.

719
00:28:02,974 --> 00:28:04,059
What does that mean?

720
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,144
It's like a mock execution.

721
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:07,270
That's not a good idea.

722
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,521
Yes, it is a good idea.

723
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,440
It's the only possible
solution I have left.

724
00:28:10,482 --> 00:28:11,941
- Well, you can actually fire
him.

725
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:15,153
- No okay, I've had enough of
you.

726
00:28:15,195 --> 00:28:16,321
Why are you telling us this?

727
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:17,697
Because I want you to behave

728
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,283
as if I'm actually firing him
Oscar, okay?

729
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:22,869
- Michael, if you hadn't told us
this,

730
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:23,995
then we would have thought

731
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:24,954
that you were actually firing-

732
00:28:24,996 --> 00:28:26,414
I'm not firing him.

733
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:30,126
I'm not, I will need you to
act like I am firing him.

734
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,461
Just what I'm going to do

735
00:28:31,503 --> 00:28:34,464
is I'm going to pretend
that I'm firing him

736
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,008
and I need you to act
like I am firing him.

737
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,926
Do you get that?

738
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:38,802
Do you get it?

739
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:39,886
I'm teaching him a lesson.

740
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,471
He needs to learn humility.

741
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,180
Alright?

742
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:43,056
That's all I'm...

743
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:43,932
Okay, here he comes.

744
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:45,725
Let's just play act.

745
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,896
Stanley, may I talk to you for a
second?

746
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,783
Stanley Hudson, you are fired.

747
00:29:09,249 --> 00:29:10,709
Are you serious?

748
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,669
I am serious.

749
00:29:12,711 --> 00:29:14,129
We are all serious.

750
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,173
You are fired like a heart
attack.

751
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,592
But I've worked here 24 years.

752
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:21,511
Ouch, that must hurt

753
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,763
because you're just one
year away from your pension

754
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:27,976
and insubordination on top
of that so no severance.

755
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:29,436
And I'm still mad at you.

756
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,063
So I'm not even going to shake
your hand when you leave,

757
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:35,025
just go clean out your desk and
get.

758
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:38,236
- You're firing me over three
words.

759
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,447
Have you lost your mind?

760
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:43,742
Do you think I'm going
to let you do this to me?

761
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:46,745
I've watched you screw up
this office for 10 years

762
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,204
and I'm filing a lawsuit

763
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,956
and I'm gonna tell them
about every stupid thing

764
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:51,458
you've ever done up in this
office.

765
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:54,127
- Alright, alright okay, you
know what?

766
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,004
Now you know how I feel.

767
00:29:56,046 --> 00:29:58,131
This was a fake firing.

768
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,175
Lesson learned.

769
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,426
Good work, everybody.

770
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:02,719
Very nice.

771
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:04,554
So I'm not fired?

772
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:05,472
That's it.

773
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:09,684
And do you have anything to say
to me?

774
00:30:09,726 --> 00:30:12,354
Oh yes, I do.

775
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,649
You are out of your little pea
sized mind.

776
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:17,942
What is wrong with you?

777
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:20,779
Do you have any sense at all?

778
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,072
Okay.

779
00:30:22,113 --> 00:30:22,614
- Do you have any idea
how to run an office?

780
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:23,990
[Michael] Yes.

781
00:30:24,032 --> 00:30:26,242
- Every day you do something
stupider than you did

782
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,619
the day before and I think,

783
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:30,914
there's no possible way he can
top that.

784
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:31,915
But what do you do?

785
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,042
You find a way dammit to top it.

786
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,627
You are a professional idiot.

787
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,544
Hey stop it!

788
00:30:38,672 --> 00:30:40,048
Okay, everybody out.

789
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,965
Who?

790
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,300
- Yeah everybody, except
Stanley.

791
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:46,721
(office shuffling)

792
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:51,518
Let's go.

793
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:52,644
I can't find my glasses.

794
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:53,812
you know what?

795
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,064
Why don't you take my hand and
leave 'em.

796
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,524
Let's get outta here.

797
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:58,525
Okay, okay.

798
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:02,612
And that means you guys,

799
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:03,738
you out.

800
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:05,573
Get out.

801
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:11,955
- Oh it's Michael versus
Stanley.

802
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,290
And it is the Clash of the
Titans.

803
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,333
In one corner,

804
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:18,461
you have Michael and he is mad.

805
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:22,340
And then in the other corner
you have Stanley and he's mad.

806
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:25,176
So that's about it.

807
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:34,269
(doors opening)

808
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,980
I don't see how this ends.

809
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:41,651
It's what my grandma would
call a Peruvian standoff.

810
00:31:41,693 --> 00:31:42,819
You know,

811
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:44,446
it's what neither person wants
to give in

812
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:47,240
because of their ignorance
or the backward culture

813
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,575
in which they were raised.

814
00:31:50,243 --> 00:31:53,913
My grandma was very racist
like most Bolivians.

815
00:31:59,544 --> 00:32:00,712
Goodbye, Xterramigo.

816
00:32:02,464 --> 00:32:05,592
you were one heck of a motor
carriage.

817
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,135
Andy...

818
00:32:07,177 --> 00:32:08,553
- I can't believe Dwight did
that.

819
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:10,513
He totally took advantage of my
kindness.

820
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,349
- He did not take advantage of
you.

821
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,017
He bested you.

822
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:14,976
You were bested.

823
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,397
Come on, come on, come on.

824
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,279
- You know, my dad gave me that
car.

825
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:29,074
So I guess it's all profit.

826
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,992
I wonder if we could get it
on Pay-Per-View or something.

827
00:32:31,034 --> 00:32:33,453
I mean, I really want to know
what's happening up there.

828
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:34,788
- I could go back for my
glasses.

829
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,498
- No, that's like going
into a burning building

830
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,957
for an ugly pair of shoes.

831
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:41,002
- Hey, what really happened
today?

832
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:42,003
What do you mean?

833
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,213
- I mean, I don't need my
glasses

834
00:32:43,254 --> 00:32:44,339
to know when somebody's
stressing you out.

835
00:32:44,381 --> 00:32:45,465
What happened today?

836
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:49,552
Ryan is trying to get rid of me.

837
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,014
He came in today to give
me an official warning

838
00:32:53,056 --> 00:32:54,557
about my job performance.

839
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:55,350
What?

840
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,811
God, he's such a creep.

841
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,939
That really pisses me off.

842
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,357
I'm going to bash his face in.

843
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,359
Then I'm gonna bash his
face in with a stale bagel.

844
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,653
Then I'm gonna throw rock at his
car.

845
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:08,071
Come on, we're going
to New York right now.

846
00:33:08,113 --> 00:33:08,988
I'm driving.

847
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,823
If I hit him without my glasses,

848
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,074
I don't think it's a crime.

849
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,701
Great.

850
00:33:12,742 --> 00:33:15,412
- God, I should have told
you all about this sooner.

851
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:17,455
- What a jerk!
- What a jerk.

852
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:21,292
(door opening)

853
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,046
(door closing)

854
00:33:27,507 --> 00:33:29,300
- I don't understand why
you keep picking on me.

855
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,593
Oh for the love of God.

856
00:33:30,635 --> 00:33:33,471
You just do I don't know why,

857
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:36,433
so please help me understand.

858
00:33:36,474 --> 00:33:39,102
Fine, here it is.

859
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:42,272
You are a person, I do not
respect.

860
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:43,982
The things you say, your
actions,

861
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:46,609
your methods and style,
everything you would do

862
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,695
I would do it the opposite way.

863
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:53,783
Well, Stanley,

864
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,454
maybe you are feeling
that you don't respect me

865
00:33:57,495 --> 00:33:59,706
because you don't know me very
well.

866
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,667
- Michael, I've known you a very
long time

867
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,627
and the more I've gotten to know
you,

868
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:06,796
the less I've come to respect to
you.

869
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,341
Any other theories?

870
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,474
Alright, you don't respect me.

871
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:19,976
I accept that.

872
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,813
But listen to me,

873
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:27,150
you can't talk to me
that way in this office.

874
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:28,276
You just can't.

875
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:29,486
I am your boss.

876
00:34:30,904 --> 00:34:31,696
Can't allow it.

877
00:34:33,281 --> 00:34:34,032
Fair enough.

878
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:40,830
(hands shaking)

879
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,833
- I am a good person and
sometimes

880
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,836
good people don't get no
respect.

881
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:47,796
Rodney Dangerfield,

882
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,133
"Hey, y'all don't get no
respect,

883
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:54,177
"no respect at all.

884
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:55,512
"When I was in the sandbox as a
kid.

885
00:34:55,553 --> 00:34:56,971
"I got no respect.

886
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:01,267
"My wife likes to talk after
sex.

887
00:35:01,309 --> 00:35:03,561
"So she called me from a hotel
room,

888
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,689
"said 'I don't respect you.'"

889
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:06,773
(sighs)

890
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:07,691
Thoughtless.

891
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:12,529
Ah, you know what don't get no
respect?

892
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,072
Airplane food.

893
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:17,575
Why don't they just make the
plane out of the airline food?

894
00:35:21,246 --> 00:35:23,540
My wife don't get no respect.

895
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,126
So take her please for example,

896
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:31,506
if you don't get no respect,
you might be redneck.

897
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:36,386
Respect is nice.

898
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:37,429
Borat.

899
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,059
What's the deal with grape nuts?

900
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,769
No grapes, no nuts.

901
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,522
I don't got no respect.

902
00:35:50,483 --> 00:35:53,445
(door opening)

903
00:35:53,486 --> 00:35:54,404
Hey Michael how'd it go?

904
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:55,947
Hey weirdo.

905
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:57,282
What are you doing?

906
00:35:57,323 --> 00:35:59,784
Hanging out, flashing
people in the parking lot?

907
00:36:01,578 --> 00:36:03,413
- No, I just stayed to see how
it went.

908
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:04,664
Are you gonna to have to fire
Stanley?

909
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:07,625
- No, no enough blood has been
bled today.

910
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,589
- Well, I think it was really
admirable.

911
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,591
The way you stuck with a problem

912
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:16,051
saw through to the end today.

913
00:36:17,177 --> 00:36:19,346
And you were good and firm
with everybody upstairs

914
00:36:19,387 --> 00:36:21,431
when you told them to leave.

915
00:36:21,473 --> 00:36:23,391
Think you earned their respect.

916
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,560
So, nice job.

917
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,521
Thank you.

918
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:31,733
But unfortunately, coming from
you,

919
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,234
that means absolutely nothing.

920
00:36:36,154 --> 00:36:37,489
Have a good night Michael.

921
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:42,327
Guy's the worst.

922
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,414
(Michael chuckles)

923
00:36:46,456 --> 00:36:50,710
So I'm thinking as a reward
for our loyal clients,

924
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,088
that we contact their assistants

925
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:55,006
and we find out where they live.

926
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:58,843
And then we go to their houses
in the middle of the summer

927
00:36:58,885 --> 00:37:00,178
and go caroling.

928
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,098
It is a summer Christmas
sale-abration

929
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:07,143
and we call it a summer
sales-a-lot.

930
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,354
Feedback?

931
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:10,480
Anybody, Stanley?

932
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:14,192
- Has potential to be your best
idea yet.

933
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,280
- That's the dumbest thing I
ever heard.

934
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,991
- Dammit Phyllis alright,
everybody out except Phyllis.

935
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:29,249
(upbeat music)
